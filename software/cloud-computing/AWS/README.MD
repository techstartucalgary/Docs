# What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the most popular and widely used cloud platform, offering over 200 services from data centers around the world. Millions of customers use AWS to reduce costs, work more efficiently, and speed up innovation.

Since AWS is a popular choice for many projects, we'll start by walking through how to set up a free account. Then, we'll explore some of the most widely-used AWS services and see how they can help you achieve your project goals.

## Free Tier

AWS figures that the more comfortable you feel working with its services, the more likely you'll eventually start moving serious workloads to its cloud. So, AWS offers a generous Free Tier for the first 12 months after opening a new account. Under the Free Tier, you can freely experiment with light versions of most AWS services without being billed.

Once ready, you can click the link below to start setting up your account.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Don't let the word "free" here trick you!  
It is always important to track your usage to make sure you are staying within the free tier limits. Once you pass the threshold, you will start getting charged instantly.
The first approach is to watch your email box for any alerts regarding passing the free tier.
