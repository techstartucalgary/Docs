# AWS Databases

## Overview of Cloud Databases

Cloud databases provide a modern solution for data storage and management. By hosting databases on the cloud, AWS allows businesses to focus on utilizing their data rather than managing database infrastructure. AWS databases offer a range of features that make them accessible, scalable, and efficient.

### Benefits of Cloud Databases

- **Scalability:** Cloud databases scale resources up or down easily to match demand, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use with AWS’s flexible pricing model.
- **Reliability:** AWS databases provide high availability and redundancy for dependable uptime.
- **Managed Services:** AWS takes care of database maintenance, backups, patching, and updates.
- **Security:** AWS databases come with robust encryption, access control, and monitoring options.

### Types of Databases on AWS

AWS offers various database types, each offering features to specific workloads and application needs.

1. **Relational Databases**

   - Structured with predefined schemas, relational databases are ideal for managing structured data and supporting complex transactions.
   - **Example:** Amazon RDS (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more).

2. **Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)**
   - Schema-less and designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, NoSQL databases offer flexibility and speed.
   - **Example:** Amazon DynamoDB, optimized for applications with high scalability and low-latency needs.
