## Create a log group in CloudWatch Logs

CloudWatch automatically creates **log groups** while receives log events from AWS services.However, you also have the flexibility to create custom log groups manually for better organization or specific use cases. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Open the CloudWatch console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.

2. In the navigation pane, choose Log groups.

3. Choose Actions, and then choose Create log group.

4. Enter a name for the log group, and then choose Create log group.

This is an example of a log group for one my lambda functions called `sign-up`

Every time this function is invoked, CloudWatch automatically generates and stores the corresponding logs in a `log stream` in its associated log group. These logs include details about the execution, such as invocation times, errors, and any custom logs youâ€™ve added within the function.
