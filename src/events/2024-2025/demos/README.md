# Demo & Pitch Nights

All Tech Start UCalgary projects are showcased to the world
at the end of each academic year.
At this event, people from different industries and backgrounds
come and give us feedback on the projects.

This is also a great opportunity for you as a professional and us
as a club to connect and network with different companies.

It's important to remember that as an entrepreneurial club, you will
also be pitching your ideas to potential investors, so your hard work
on the business strategy will be on display here. Pitching your start-up
in a convincing manner is a critical skill, so we also give you the opportunity to
practice this in the demos leading up to the final showcase.
