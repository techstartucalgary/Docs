# Interim Showcase

## 12 February 2026

The Interim Showcase is your second opportunity to clearly communicate what you’re building, why it matters, and why your solution stands out to industry guests, and for the first time this semester, the general public. In a concise 7-minute pitch, we’re looking for a strong demo, a clear problem and target audience, an explanation of how your solution works, and confidence in both the technical and business aspects. By the end, the audience should understand your product’s vision, value, and potential impact.

### Time

6PM - 8PM

### Location

ENG 03

### Time per team

Hard cutoff at 15mins

Target 7 minutes for your presentation, 3 minutes for Q&A (10 minutes total - remember that your pitch going for much longer than the other teams can make it feel less focused and polished in comparison.)

### Dress code

Business casual, try to coordinate with your team for a professional cohesive look

### Key Elements

#### Demonstration (Video or Live Encouraged)

- Provide a compelling demonstration of the product through a pre-recorded video or a live walkthrough to showcase its functionality.
- If you are not in a state where a demo is possible / all the features can’t be shown feel free to add to the Figma Designs to your slides.

#### Brand Identity (Final Name & Logo)

- Present the finalized product name, slogan and logo to establish a strong brand presence.
- Doesn’t need to be a formal slide but should be apparent on the slide deck/ introduction.

#### Technical Knowledge (No Code Submission, But Understand the Codebase)

- While no code submission is required, be prepared to explain the architecture, technology stack, and key technical decisions.

#### Problem Statement (Why This Matters & Target Audience)

- Clearly define the problem your product solves, why it’s important, and who the primary users are.

#### Solution

- How you are solving the problem and why people would be willing to pay for your solution
   - If you’re introducing a new or unique workflow or technology, talk about it and briefly discuss how it's implemented.

#### Go-To-Market Strategy & Roadmap

- Give some indication of how large the target market is (Could do TAM, SAM, SOM market sizing)
- Outline how you plan to attract users, the development timeline, key milestones, and when revenue generation will begin.

#### Revenue Model (How You Make Money)

- Explain the business model, pricing strategy, and revenue streams.

#### Competitive Analysis (Market Landscape & Why You’re Better)

- Compare your solution to existing competitors, highlighting your unique advantages through a competitive matrix.

#### (Optional) Team Composition & Skills

- Provide an overview of your team, their expertise, and how their skills contribute to the success of the project.

### Keys to Success

- Understand your audience:
  - What might their backgrounds be? Are there any jargon I am using?
  - What do they know about my project? What message/impact do I hope to leave them with?
- Complete your slide deck
- Practice your 7 minute pitch -- and make sure to consider the length of your demo video (if you choose to have one)
- Complete your demo video
- Have your tech stack and architecture solidified

### Tips

- Have 2-3 designated presenters for your team
- No need to show/explain code live, but be ready to answer questions about your tech stack, and how you implemented specific features of your project.

### Important Note
**Please send your final presentations to the presidents via discord by February 11 at noon**
