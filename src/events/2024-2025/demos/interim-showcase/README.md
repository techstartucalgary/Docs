# Interim Showcase

## 13 February 2025

### Time

6PM - 8PM

### Location

Engineering Atrium

### Time per team

7 minutes for your presentation, 3 minutes for Q&A

### Dress code

Business casual, try to coordinate with your team for a professional cohesive look

### Key Elements

#### Tech Stack

1. A document containing a list of every technology your team has been using / plan to use, with a short paragraph for each technology that answers the following questions:

   - What is it being used for?
   - How will it fit with the rest of the tech stack?
   - How does it stack up to its alternatives (pros/cons)?
   - What experience does your team have with it / what difficulty has your team been having with it?

2. A near final diagram of how all of your technologies link together (how does information move between technologies?)

**NOTE:** Due to Earth's Echo being a video game made with Unity, they are exempt from these requirements, although please still come well informed and prepared to answer questions on what tools you used in Unity to create the different components of the game.

### EMERGENCY BACKUP

- In case of technical issues, send your presentation to VP Internal (Maheen) by noon Feb 13

### Keys to Success

- Understand your audience:
  - What might their backgrounds be? Are there any jargon I am using?
  - What do they know about my project? What message/impact do I hope to leave them with?
- Complete your slide deck
- Practice your 7 minute pitch -- and make sure to consider the length of your demo video (if you choose to have one)
- Complete your demo video
- Have your tech stack and architecture solidified

### Tips

- Have 2-3 designated presenters for your team
- No need to show/explain code live, but be ready to answer questions about your tech stack, and how you implemented specific features of your project.
