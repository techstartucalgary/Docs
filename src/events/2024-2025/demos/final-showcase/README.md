### Presentation Time Limit

15 minutes for presentation (hard limit)

We will have a timer clearly visible for you

5 minutes for questions

We will also be allowing 3 mins for each team during the judging break to let the judges play with their product. 

### Presentation Logistics

There are 3 microphones: 1 clip-on, 1 hand-held, and 1 on the podium. If you're presenting it's a good idea to be familiar with how to use these to make your presentation go more smoothly.

MacBooks with Apple Silicon chips have had issues with the projector system, so bring Intel MacBooks or Windows/Linux devices.

We will have USB-C to HDMI adapters if you need, but we suggest having your own prepared and testing it out before the presentations start.

### Dress Code: Business Casual or Business

## Rubric

There are no predefined milestones or goals for the final showcase, as every team has their own specific goals.

Our judges will be using the rubric below to give feedback, as well as general feedback to each team.

They will also choose winners for the following categories: Best Overall, Best Design, and Best Technology.

Note, one team **can** win more than one award.
