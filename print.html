<p>Hi there!
This website contains tutorials, how-to guides, explanations,
and reference documentation of the things we do at
<a href="https://techstartucalgary.com">Tech Start UCalgary</a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking for our main page,
please visit us at <a href="https://techstartucalgary.com">techstartucalgary.com</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="demo--pitch-nights"><a class="header" href="#demo--pitch-nights">Demo &amp; Pitch Nights</a></h1>
<p>All Tech Start UCalgary projects are showcased to the world
at the end of each academic year.
At this event, people from different industries and backgrounds
come and give us feedback on the projects.</p>
<p>This is also a great opportunity for you as a professional and us
as a club to connect and network with different companies.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that as an entrepreneurial club, you will
also be pitching your ideas to potential investors, so your hard work
on the business strategy will be on display here. Pitching your start-up
in a convincing manner is a critical skill, so we also give you the opportunity to
practice this in the demos leading up to the final showcase.</p>

<h3 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h3>
<p>Let everyone know what your product idea is, present progress so far and next steps.</p>
<p>This lets the executive and project support teams know how far you are and what your vision is to best provide the support and resources you need.</p>
<p>There will be more pitches and demos to come, so this will be a good warmup for them (as well as being a valuable skill in industry).</p>
<h3 id="start-time"><a class="header" href="#start-time">Start Time</a></h3>
<p>6 PM sharp</p>
<h3 id="time-limit"><a class="header" href="#time-limit">Time Limit</a></h3>
<p><strong>Hard</strong> cutoff at 5 minutes</p>
<p>Then 3 minutes for Q&amp;A</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do"><a class="header" href="#what-to-do">What to do</a></h2>
<p>Clearly state what exactly you're doing, what problem you're solving (if applicable), and how you plan to approach it.</p>
<p>Make it engaging and interesting, leave the audience with something memorable.</p>
<p>In your slide deck, avoid walls of text at all cost, use visuals instead.</p>
<p>We recommend not having more than 3 people presenting as this really messes with your presentation's flow as you hand off to them.</p>
<p>Speak loudly and clearly so everyone can hear you! Use the LAV mic if possible, and learn how to use it correctly. This <a href="https://youtu.be/wd_f7iYbFrA">video</a> may help. Whatever you do, do not speak into it directly, you will make very loud and annoying popping sounds.</p>
<p>Rehearse your pitch and keep it under the time limit.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-do"><a class="header" href="#what-not-to-do">What not to do</a></h2>
<p>Don't get bogged down by details, this is a high level overview of your idea.</p>
<p>Don't get too technical, assume your audience is investors who know nothing about programming.</p>

<p>It's important that it's professional and colorful, and that it grabs the user's attention.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the following elements
are present on the first page:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Logo and name</strong>:
A good logo is going to make the project look respected
and professional.</p>
<p>A good name is able to encapsulate the project's purpose,
or, at the very least, should give the project an identity.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a>
project:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./prettier-logo.svg" alt="Prettier logo" /></p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it encapsulates the purpose of the project:
&quot;Making your code prettier&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slogan</strong>:
A short, catchy phrase,
summarizing what the project does and its most hot features.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">FastAPI</a>
project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. Yes, I want high-performance APIs.
I want things easy to learn,
with no boilerplate,
and robust enough for production.</p>
<p>While short,
this slogan is very important
because it's displayed on the project card:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./fastapi-slogan.png" alt="FastAPI slogan" /></p>
<p>It can be the first thing a new visitor sees
and therefore can be the decisive factor
for a user to click on it.</p>
<p>It's also displayed on the top of the project home page:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./fast-api-about.png" alt="FastAPI about" /></p>
<p>And sets the expectations for what comes next,
it needs to be good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>:
Here you will have a few paragraphs to
explain what your project does,
what problem it solves for your users,
and why should a user be using it right now.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">FastAPI</a>
project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance),
web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+
based on standard Python type hints.</p>
<p>The key features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast</strong>: Very high performance, on par with <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>Go</strong> (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). <a href="projects/readme/index.html#performance">One of the fastest Python frameworks available</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast to code</strong>: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fewer bugs</strong>: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intuitive</strong>: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easy</strong>: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Short</strong>: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Robust</strong>: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standards-based</strong>: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification" class="external-link" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> (previously known as Swagger) and <a href="https://json-schema.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank">JSON Schema</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><small>* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the user knows that FastAPI helps build APIs with Python.
They should be using FastAPI right now
because it's fast, intuitive, easy, and so on.</p>
<p>It's always a good idea to throw a few power-words like: &quot;Fast&quot;, &quot;Powerful&quot;, &quot;Secure&quot;, and &quot;Reliable&quot;,
but of course, make sure that this is true.</p>
<p>You can further improve this section by adding emojis.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/kamadorueda/alejandra">Alejandra</a>
project:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./alejandra-description.png" alt="Alejandra description" /></p>
<p>To this point, your users should have a clear understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem does your project solve?</li>
<li>How does it make the user's life easier?</li>
<li>What is special about it? What are the key features?</li>
</ul>
<p>But also make sure not to show unnecessary details.
Try to find a balance.
Too short and you'll leave questions unanswered.
Too long and you'll bore or confuse them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong>:
Users are interested at this point,
they want action now.</p>
<p>Here we place the shortest path a user can take
to interact with the project.
If there are many, show the fastest/easiest one first,
and then slowly introduce them to the more complex ones.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/kamadorueda/alejandra">Alejandra</a>
project:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./alejandra-getting-started.png" alt="Alejandra Getting Started" /></p>
<p>It simply tells the user to use a web version of the project.
Everybody knows how to click a link, that's easy and nice.</p>
<p>This is an example from the
<a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a>
project:</p>
<p><img src="projects/readme/./prettier-getting-started.png" alt="Prettier Getting Started" /></p>
<p>Users familiar with Node JS
will find the instructions easy to follow.
However,
some steps could have been removed
and it would have worked the same.
There is no need to overwhelm the user with details at this point.
We can introduce the details later.</p>
<p>For example, a better version would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Install prettier with:</p>
<p><code>$ npm install --save-dev prettier</code></p>
<p>Make your code beautiful with:</p>
<p><code>$ npx prettier --write .</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember to keep the first impression simple and intuitive.</p>
<p>Simplicity is key here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is no legal advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For good or bad,
all of the code that we write
is subject to the following Intellectual Property rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong>: The right to reproduce,
derivate,
distribute copies, and use the copyrighted work,
and to extend these rights to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moral Rights</strong>:
The right of being attributed as the author of the work,
and the right to prevent prejudicial distortions of the work (integrity).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both concepts can be expanded a little bit more
by reading the following documents
from the U.S. Copyright Office:
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/policy/moralrights/">2</a>.
It is a very interesting topic.</p>
<p>For the time being,
think of these rights
as a way for the rights holder
to decide on who and what can be done with the protected work.
Further, without explicit authorization from the rights holder,
you are effectively limited by law from doing anything at all with the work,
unless you can cite <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">Fair Use</a>.</p>
<p>If you go and read your employee contract,
you'll find that the rights over the work you do for your employer
are &quot;assigned&quot; to the employer
(transferred from you to them),
that you won't exercise your Moral Right of integrity over the work,
and (with luck)
that they'll respect your Moral Right of being attributed,
plus many more clauses that are similar in nature.</p>
<p>There is also a third concept called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">The Public Domain</a>,
which are works to which no Intellectual Property rights apply,
either because they expired,
but usually, because they were expressly waived by the holder.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Public_Domain_Mark_button.svg/132px-Public_Domain_Mark_button.svg.png" alt="Public Domain Logo" /></p>
<p>Whether the existence of these rights is good or bad
I leave it for you to think about,
but I'll throw some good articles and books here:

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="a-roadmap"><a class="header" href="#a-roadmap">A RoadMap</a></h1>
<p>A RoadMap is one of the best ways to manifest the future vision of your product
and the strategy and steps
that will be used for achieving that vision.</p>
<p>A RoadMap is also a great tool to cooperate with other people
because you can prioritize on it the steps
that are yet to be done,
and see who's working on what,
what progress has been made,
and so on.</p>
<p>This is an example from the Makes project on GitHub:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./makes-roadmap.png" alt="Makes RoadMap" /></p>
<p>That's a simple RoadMap, yet it has all the important information.
That's nice!</p>
<p>I highly recommend you create your RoadMap using the Projects feature on GitHub
because it integrates very well with other GitHub features
like Issues, Pull Requests and Milestones,
but it's also fine if you use <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>
or <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb,
anything related to making your project awesome
can (and should) go into the RoadMap.
It's also not limited to just programming tasks,
you could perfectly add to the RoadMap
a meeting with your users,
some market research activity,
or having some Pizza with the team.</p>
<p>A RoadMap is also a living creature,
it evolves as the project evolves
and you can iterate on it on the go.
Don't worry if you don't get it perfectly from the beginning,
but make sure you have one from the beginning!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-roadmap"><a class="header" href="#how-to-create-a-roadmap">How to create a RoadMap?</a></h2>
<h3 id="step-1---start-with-milestones"><a class="header" href="#step-1---start-with-milestones">Step 1 - Start with Milestones</a></h3>
<p>My suggestion is that you start by creating a few
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones">Milestones</a>.</p>
<p>Think about what your project wants to achieve:
Is it maybe a website that allows you to shorten URLs,
like <a href="https://tinyurl.com">https://tinyurl.com</a>?</p>
<p>What's the <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">minimum viable product</a> that you can deliver to your users
so that they can start getting a taste?</p>
<p>You are right!
An ugly webpage, with an ugly textbox and an ugly button,
that when clicked, gives you a beautifully shortened URL :)</p>
<p>But that's even too far in the future.
What about making your first Milestone
about having an empty webpage?
Your second Milestone could be having a backend that answers a ping request.
Your third Milestone can be designing the database,
such that it stores the shortened URLs;
and your fourth Milestone can be adding the textbox and button to the front-end,
and an endpoint in the back-end that stores and retrieves the shortened URL.</p>
<p>You see?
we just planned a <a href="https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp">minimum viable product</a>,
using an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/plan/what-is-agile">agile methodology</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<h3 id="step-2---split-the-milestones-in-smaller-issues"><a class="header" href="#step-2---split-the-milestones-in-smaller-issues">Step 2 - Split the Milestones in smaller Issues</a></h3>
<p>Now we can proceed to define the individual tasks (GitHub Issues)
that are needed for completing each Milestone,
and most importantly,
we can assign each member of our team an Issue,
and work collaboratively towards the same goal.</p>
<p>Bonus points if we can plan it so that they can all work in parallel.</p>
<p>For example,
for Milestone #1 (Having an empty webpage that the user can access),
we could create the following Issues:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./milestone-1-plan.png" alt="Milestone 1 Plan" /></p>
<p>In words:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue #1</strong>: Create a Git repository.
<ul>
<li>Priority: Medium.</li>
<li>Assignee: John.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issue #2</strong>, after Issue #1: Add a license.
<ul>
<li>Priority: High.</li>
<li>Assignee: Olivia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issue #3</strong>, after Issue #1: Add a README.md.
<ul>
<li>Priority: Medium.</li>
<li>Assignee: Jane.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issue #4</strong>, after Issue #1: Initialize an empty React project.
<ul>
<li>Priority: Medium.</li>
<li>Assignee: Oliver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Issue #5</strong>, after Issue #4: Use GitHub actions to deploy the front-end into GitHub pages.
<ul>
<li>Priority: Medium.</li>
<li>Assignee: John. (John should be free, since finishing #4 means #1 was finished).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Done.</p>
<p>Now create more Issues for all of the other Milestones.</p>
<h3 id="step-3---add-your-issues-to-the-roadmap"><a class="header" href="#step-3---add-your-issues-to-the-roadmap">Step 3 - Add your Issues to the RoadMap</a></h3>
<p>My suggestion for this is to keep it simple.
Avoid too many labels, statuses and complexity.</p>
<p>First, create a Project (a RoadMap) on GitHub.
This is usually under the Projects tab in the organization view:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./new-project.png" alt="New Project on GitHub" /></p>
<p>Then define some statuses:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./status-field.png" alt="Status Field" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>🆕 New</strong>: Where you place all of the issues initially.</li>
<li><strong>📋 Backlog</strong>: The issues that are yet to be done, and their priority.</li>
<li><strong>🏗 In progress</strong>: The issues that are being worked on, and who's working on them.</li>
<li><strong>✅ Done</strong>: The issues that have been shipped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, create a priority field:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./priority-fields.png" alt="Priority Field" /></p>
<p>This will help your team focus on the things
that are more impactful to your project.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management">Eisenhower matrix</a> for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>🌋 High priority</strong>: Issues that are important and urgent.</li>
<li><strong>🏔 Medium priority</strong>: Issues that are important, but not urgent.</li>
<li><strong>🏕 Low priority</strong>: Issues that are not important, but may be nice to have someday.</li>
<li><strong>🏝 Never priority</strong>: Just close the issue :) don't waste your time on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can start adding Issues to your RoadMap:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./makes-roadmap.png" alt="Makes RoadMap" /></p>
<p>And see what is the progress towards each Milestone, for example:</p>
<p><img src="projects/roadmap/./milestones-progress.png" alt="Milestones Progress" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="career-paths"><a class="header" href="#career-paths">Career Paths</a></h1>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="front-end"><a class="header" href="#front-end">Front End</a></h1>
<p>A front-end engineer is a software engineer who specializes in building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application. They are responsible for creating visually appealing and intuitive designs that allow users to interact with the application or website seamlessly.</p>
<p>The front-end engineer's job involves using various technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements of an application or website. They work closely with designers to turn mockups and wireframes into fully functional websites or applications that are easy to use and navigate.</p>
<p>Front-end engineers also collaborate with back-end engineers to integrate the front-end code with the back-end code, ensuring that the entire system functions correctly. They are responsible for testing and debugging the front-end code, optimizing the code for performance, and ensuring that the website or application is compatible with different browsers and devices.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-become-a-front-end-engineer"><a class="header" href="#how-to-become-a-front-end-engineer">How to become a front-end engineer?</a></h2>
<p>To become a front-end engineer, you will need to follow these general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>

<p>DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and IT operations professionals. The goal of DevOps is to improve the efficiency and quality of software development by breaking down silos and promoting a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Traditionally (<a href="https://clickup.com/blog/waterfall-project-management/">https://clickup.com/blog/waterfall-project-management/</a>), software development and IT operations have been two separate functions within organizations, with little interaction between them. DevOps seeks to bridge this gap by fostering collaboration between these teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and development to deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>DevOps involves using tools and practices such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure automation to streamline the software development process and make it more efficient. By automating tasks like testing, building, and deploying software, teams can reduce errors, speed up the development process, and deliver software more quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>Overall, DevOps is a holistic approach to software development that aims to create a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement, with the goal of delivering software more efficiently and with higher quality.</p>

<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>At some point in your career you will need to demo some work you've done to both technical and non-technical stakeholders (people with an interest in the work you're doing).</p>
<p>When you do this, you want to make sure you give yourself and your team the best opportunity to show off your hard work. Here are some tips and ideas to think about when preparing, and do prepare if it's for anyone other than your own team.</p>
<h2 id="purpose"><a class="header" href="#purpose">Purpose</a></h2>
<p>The work you did will have achieved something, whether it's fixing a bug, solving a problem for your users, or presenting an entirely new idea.</p>
<p>It's important to show this if you want to convince others that your work is important. Feel free to show the existing problem and then go into how you have addressed it, this will make the change that much more impactful.</p>
<h2 id="presentation"><a class="header" href="#presentation">Presentation</a></h2>
<p>Live demos are always best, it proves to your audience that it actually works and that there's no smoke and mirrors hiding flaws. However, there are cases where live demos don't work out. Maybe you have a very slow running process, or your code just decides it's not going to work that day.</p>
<p>For slow processes, explain that it's slow and why, and let the audience know how you've addressed it in the demo to set the right expectations.</p>
<p>Here are some methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the process before starting the demo in another tab/instance/device, and switch to that when you need to show what happens after it.</li>
<li>Do something else while it's running, e.g. talk about some other detail in your presentation.</li>
<li>Pre-record the whole demo and speed up or cut out the slow parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a good idea to have a well-edited pre-recorded demo to switch to as well, sometimes code just decides not to work!</p>
<p>Make sure you've practiced talking over the pre-recorded demo as well as the live demo so you're prepared for all cases, including switching from live to recorded halfway through.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-distractions"><a class="header" href="#avoid-distractions">Avoid Distractions</a></h3>
<p>It's not the end of the world, but a notification popping up on your screen is distracting to the audience.</p>
<p>It's best to fully close all unneeded apps, turn on do-not-disturb, and full-screen what you're presenting.</p>
<p>This also goes for browser tabs and bookmarks, have everything as clean and empty as possible so all the focus is on what you're presenting.</p>
<p>Use Virtual Desktops on Windows and full-screen apps on MacOS. Place your presentation in one, and the demo in another, that way you can quickly and seamlessly switch between the two without alt-tabbing or exiting the presentation.</p>
<h2 id="prepare"><a class="header" href="#prepare">Prepare</a></h2>
<p>Most importantly, rehearse the demo! Go through everything you want to show off, and have a good idea of what you want to say. It doesn't need to be perfectly memorized, but you should know exactly what you're doing next all the time. If you're working with a team, and one person is speaking and the other controlling the demo, make sure both of you are in sync. If you say &quot;looking at the user profile page&quot;, the demo should immediately go there, without you having to ask your partner to do things which breaks the flow.</p>
<p>Finally, if (and when) something goes wrong, the best thing to do is to move past it. Bringing more attention to an issue can make it seem worse than it is. If things are really bad (app fully crashes, laptop catches fire), you have a recorded demo to switch to. Right?</p>

<p>Django is a free and open source python framework that lets you build awesome backends for websites, apps, and more. You can use it to host databases and build secure APIs for them without writing a line of SQL. You can also use it to create multi-page applications with dynamically served content. It makes it easy to get started building complex functionalities by automating a lot of the boilerplate code that you'd normally have to write. </p>
<p>We recommend that you have a basic knowledge of python before using django! This will help you debug any errors that you get.</p>

<h4 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h4>
<p>First you will need to install Homebrew, Python, Pip, and Pyenv. If you have not done so already, please follow the instructions in the <a href="guides/Django_Guide/../../installation/installfest/README.html">Installfest</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h4>
<p>To create a Django project first wee need to create a directory for the project. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir &lt;project-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we need to navigate to the directory we just created. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd &lt;project-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we need to create a virtual environment for our project. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pyenv virtualenv .venv
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we need to activate the virtual environment. You need to do this every time you want to run your project. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">source .venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to deactivate your virtual environment when you're done working on your project, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">deactivate
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we need to install Django. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install django
</code></pre>
<p>To check if Django is installed, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 -m django --version 
</code></pre>
<p>Next, let's create a project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">django-admin startproject &lt;project-name&gt; . # the dot is important! it will create the project in the current directory
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Good to know: Projects vs. apps
What's the difference between a django project and a django app? An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py startapp &lt;your-app-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This creates an app within your project. You can create as many apps as you want within a project.</p>
<p>Next step: include your app in the INSTALLED_APPS fields in settings.py (just the name)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    ...
    'your-app-name',
]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="installing-dotenv"><a class="header" href="#installing-dotenv">Installing Dotenv</a></h4>
<p>Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology. To install dotenv, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install python-dotenv
</code></pre>
<p>Then freeze the requirements. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a file called requirements.txt that will contain all the packages that are installed in your virtual environment. This file will be useful for when you need to install the same packages in another virtual environment. <strong>After adding a new package to your virtual environment, you will need to freeze the requirements again.</strong></p>
<p>Next, go to your project and create a .env file. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch .env
</code></pre>
<p>Then go to your settings.py file and add the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
from dotenv import load_dotenv

...

load_dotenv()

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
# Copy the secret key from the .env file
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv(&quot;DJANGO_SECRET_KEY&quot;, get_random_secret_key())
</code></pre>
<p>Your .env file should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-.env">DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
</code></pre>
<h4 id="installing-postgres-and-psycopg2"><a class="header" href="#installing-postgres-and-psycopg2">Installing Postgres and psycopg2</a></h4>
<p>PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. To install Postgres, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew install postgresql
</code></pre>
<p>To check if Postgres is installed, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">postgres --version
</code></pre>
<p>psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language. To install psycopg2, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install psycopg2
</code></pre>
<p>Then freeze the requirements. To do so, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then go to your settings.py file and add the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'psycopg2',
]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="creating-a-postgres-database"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-postgres-database">Creating a Postgres database</a></h4>
<p>To create a Postgres database, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">createdb &lt;database-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember your credentials for the database. You will need them later.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to install pgAdmin, a free and open-source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL and its related database management systems. To install pgAdmin, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew install --cask pgadmin4
</code></pre>
<h4 id="connecting-django-to-postgres"><a class="header" href="#connecting-django-to-postgres">Connecting Django to Postgres</a></h4>
<p>Add the following code to your .env file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">DATABASE_NAME=&lt;database-name&gt;
DATABASE_USER=&lt;database-user&gt;
DATABASE_PASSWORD=&lt;database-password&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to your settings.py file and add the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os

...

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': os.getenv('DATABASE_NAME'),
        'USER': os.getenv('DATABASE_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,
        'PORT': &quot;5432&quot;,
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="writing-models"><a class="header" href="#writing-models">Writing Models</a></h4>
<p><strong>Models</strong> allow you to define the content of your database. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If you don't need content in your database, you won't need models.</span></p>
<p>You can follow along with this section here:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/</a></p>
<p>More about models: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/</a></p>
<p>You will define all your models in models.py, located within the folder for your app.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class Album(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    artist = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    year_released = models.DateField()
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.name)

class Song(models.Model):
    song_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    album = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    num_streams = models.IntegerField()
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.song_name)
</code></pre>
<p>Each model should correspond to the structure of a table of a relational model of a database. If you don't know what this means, ask someone who has taken CPSC 471 (or an equivalent databases course)</p>
<p>Django can convert these into real SQL tables!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Good to know: Primary Keys</em></strong>: In the above example we didn't specify any ids for our models (normally, with databases, you want an id to be your primary key). Django automatically creates an ID field to be the primary key for each model and takes care of auto-incrementing, unless you specifically override it. I don't recommend overriding, it's not worth the effort (and its doubly complicated and not worth it to have a primary key composed of several fields)</li>
<li><strong><em>Good to know: <strong>str</strong>:</em></strong> the <strong>str</strong> function is Python's default function for string representation. In this case, it's good practice to override this for your models. This will help you understand your data if you login via the admin view (I'll show how to do this later)</li>
<li><strong><em>Good to know: Foreign Keys</em></strong>: See the Song model class for how you can reference a foreign key belonging to another model (in this case it refers to Album). You don't need to refer to a foreign model's keys directly, all you need to do is specify which table you are referencing. Also note: if you are referring to a table, it needs to be defined above the point in the code where you are referring to it. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are more options that can be explored about how you can define your models, but this should be a good base for you to do your own research :)</p>
<p>Now we're ready to convert these into a real database! By default, Django will make a migration file that has your database.</p>
<pre><code>Converting models into your database

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/

&gt;&gt; python3 manage.py makemigrations appName
Creates migrations for the changes you made in appName

&gt;&gt; python3 manage.py migrate
Migrates the changes you made into your database

</code></pre>
<h4 id="run-your-app"><a class="header" href="#run-your-app">Run your app</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you are ready to run your server, just call this command!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py runserver 
</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/./images/django-initial-page.png" alt="django-initial-page" /></p>
<p>By default, this will run the Django server on localhost:8000. View the django documentation to see how you can run it on a different port. You can now access it from your web browser by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a> !</p>
<p>You can also create a superuser (admin) to view the inner contents of your database. To do this, you first need to create them from the command line using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username yourNameHere --email yours@email.ca
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a super user with your provided info (it will prompt you to enter a password as well). </p>
<p>The following command creates a token for the superuser that you can use for authentication in requests. If you are not using Django Rest Framework, this is not applicable to you.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py drf_create_token yourSuperUserName
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> if you're trying to run these for your deployed app on heroku, you need to prepend <code>heroku run </code>before those commands! See the Heroku section for a description on how you can deploy it. </p>
<p>You can see the admin page of your website to view the inner content of your database. This is automatically created by Django. Visit <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin">http://localhost:8000/admin</a> and enter your passcode. </p>
<p>If you want your models to show up in the admin page, you will need to specify them in admin.py like this:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Album, Song
# Register your models here.

admin.site.register(Album)
admin.site.register(Song)
</code></pre>
<p>Once you log in to the admin site, you should see something like this. From here, you can add &amp; remove database entries. 
<img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image19.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<h2 id="urls"><a class="header" href="#urls">URLs</a></h2>
<p><strong>URLs</strong> allow you to define the paths that exist in your system, and what happens when you call them.</p>
<p>URLs documentation: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/urls/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/urls/</a></p>
<p>How URLs are processed in Django: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#how-django-processes-a-request">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#how-django-processes-a-request</a></p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial03/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial03/</a></p>
<p>If you're constructing a big application, it's standard practice in django to include different _apps _for each part of your system, and link them to the main project.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image6.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>However, since we're only making small-scale side-projects, it's fine to ignore this best-practice and include everything in a single app. Just understand that in a large industrial scale project you wouldn't necessarily want to do this.</p>
<p>// urls.py in a project:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myApp/', include('myApp.urls'))
]
</code></pre>
<p>// example urls.py in myApp folder:</p>
<pre><code>from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello_world', views.ping, name='Hello World!'),
    path('hello-x/&lt;str:hello_to&gt;', views.hellox, name='Hello to x'),
    path('hello-x/&lt;print_me&gt;/print', views.printx, name='Print this!'),
    path('goodbye', views.goodbye, name='goodbye'),
]
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can visit a path using <a href="http://localhost:8000/myApp/hello-world">http://localhost:8000/myApp/hello-world</a>, for example.</p>
<h2 id="views"><a class="header" href="#views">Views</a></h2>
<p>**Views **allow you to define what happens when you access a certain url in your system (using your browser, an API tool like Postman, or something else altogether). In your views, you could define interactions with the model (your database) or entirely different interactions altogether. You can use the definition of the view to call external processes.</p>
<p>If you want to make more complicated views and understand the Request and Response items, read this: </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/request-response/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/request-response/</a></p>
<p>To understand views more in-depth, read the documentation: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/views/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/views/</a></p>
<p>Here are some simple examples of what you <em>can</em> do with a view. Note that these are just examples and don't represent best practice at all. </p>
<pre><code>from django.http import HttpResponse, response
# views.py
def ping(request):
    myRes = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
    return HttpResponse(myRes)

def hellox(request, hello_to):
    myRes = {&quot;My Reply&quot;: &quot;Hello &quot; + hello_to}
    return response.JsonResponse(myRes)

def printx(request, print_me):
    print(&quot;Hello to &quot; + print_me)
    return response.HttpResponseNotFound(&quot;I printed it!&quot;)

def goodbye(request):
    if not (request.method == 'GET'):
        return response.HttpResponseBadRequest()
    queryParams = request.GET
    msg = queryParams.get('msg', &quot;Gamers&quot;)
    return response.JsonResponse({&quot;Reply&quot;: &quot;Goodbye &quot; + msg})
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we want to adhere to DRY (Don't repeat yourself) when creating views. Therefore, it is almost always best to define your views as Class-Based views (CBVs) which handle more of the boiler plate code for you and help ensure your views follow standards.</p>
<p>Please read more about class-based views here: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/class-based-views/</a></p>
<p>Both the above docs and the docs for views also show how you can interact with your database items through a view. But, if you're building an API, I highly recommend using the tools in the following section: Django REST Framework.</p>
<p>Once you have defined your views and given them a corresponding url, you can test them out. </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py runserver 
</code></pre>
<p>Run your server, and using either a web browser, or preferably an API testing tool like Postman (<a href="https://www.postman.com/">https://www.postman.com/</a>)  access the proper urls (ex. <a href="http://localhost:8000/myApp/hello_world">http://localhost:8000/myApp/hello_world</a>) to see if they have the expected behavior. </p>
<h4 id="django-rest-framework"><a class="header" href="#django-rest-framework">Django REST Framework</a></h4>
<p>Django REST Framework is an add-on to Django that makes it simple to develop REST-compliant APIs. There is great documentation here: <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/</a> <strong><em>&lt;--- FOLLOW INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS</em></strong></p>
<p><em>What is a RESTful framework? Learn more here: <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">https://restfulapi.net/</a></em></p>
<p>Django REST Framework provides you with tools to make class-based views to easily implement database CRUD (Create Read Update Destroy) operations, as well as define more complex operations. </p>
<p>Before we define any endpoints with Django REST Framework, let's make some serializers.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image15.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<h4 id="serializers"><a class="header" href="#serializers">Serializers</a></h4>
<p>Django REST Framework uses serializers as a way to perform **translation **of your models from your python code and your database into data formats like JSON and XML that an API might use. Read more about them here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/</a></p>
<p>We should define some basic serializers so that we can make API endpoints that interact with the content of our database models.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file called serializers.py inside the app you want to use serializers with. </li>
<li>Create your serializers. Give them a relevant name (though the exact syntax is not important)</li>
<li>List the fields that you want your serializer to translate. If you don't want it to translate a particular field, then don't include it. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here's an example, using the Song and Album models we defined earlier. Here's what's at the top of serializers.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import *

class SongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = (&quot;id&quot;, &quot;song_name&quot;, &quot;num_streams&quot;)

class AlbumSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Album
        fields = (&quot;name&quot;, &quot;year_released&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;, &quot;id&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure your fields match exactly the names that you used in your models.</p>
<p>You may be curious why I also included an id, when we didn't define one in our models- this is because Django auto generated an id for us in this models because we didn't specify a primary key. This id field always has the name id. It is often useful for our API, so we'll include it. </p>
<p>We can also create multiple serializers for the same models, if we wanted different behavior. For example, what if we wanted to include the album id of the song?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class SongSerializerWithAlbumId(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta: 
        model = Song
        fields = (&quot;id&quot;, &quot;song_name&quot;, &quot;num_streams&quot;, &quot;album&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This would include the album's PK (in this case, it's id, but if the PK was different, it'd be something else).</p>
<p>What if we wanted to include the full album info when an api request was made to see the song? Here's another example serializer that we could make:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class SongSerializerFullAlbum(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    myFullAlbumDesc = AlbumSerializer(&quot;album&quot;, read_only=True)
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = (&quot;id&quot;, &quot;song_name&quot;, &quot;num_streams&quot;, &quot;myFullAlbumDesc&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>It's using our album serializer from earlier to serialize a field, which must (read only is an optional parameter that makes it so that it's only included in reading requests, not create/update/destroy.)</p>
<p>This was just an introduction to serializers. If you want to use more complex behaviors, you'll have to do the research on your own.</p>
<h4 id="django-rest-framework-class-based-views"><a class="header" href="#django-rest-framework-class-based-views">Django REST Framework: Class based Views</a></h4>
<pre><code>Pre-requisite to this section: understand URLS and views in vanilla Django, and read the serializers section
</code></pre>
<p>More reading: <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/3-class-based-views/">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/3-class-based-views/</a></p>

<p>You can use Django's Class Based Views to quickly create views that can do CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) operations on your database.</p>
<p>In views.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework import status
from .models import *
from .serializers import *
</code></pre>
<p>Some class based views that we'll define. Right now these are just the generic create, read, update, destroy views. By defining these views with the classes, Django REST Framework takes care of the default behavior for us. It's that easy!</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class SaveSong(generics.CreateAPIView):
    queryset = Song.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SongSerializerWithAlbumId

class GetSongs(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Song.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SongSerializer

class DeleteSong(generics.DestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Song.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SongSerializer

class UpdateSong(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):
    queryset = Song.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SongSerializerWithAlbumId
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we need to make the create and update serializers include the album ID- if we didn't then you couldn't create song objects since their album id must be _not null._This same principal applies to any model that has a foreign key which isn't allowed to be null. </p>
<p>Before we can use the views we created, we need to hook them up to a URL, just like you would for any other view. Do keep in mind that we need to call the as-view function on them, though. Here is an example of the URLs for the previous views. This pattern is how we normally define CRUD endpoint urls for any entity in a database</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    path('song', views.GetSongs.as_view(), name='songs'),
    # Create a song
    path('song/create', views.SaveSong.as_view(), name='Save Song'),
    #Updates a specified license with information
    path('song/&lt;int:pk&gt;', views.UpdateSong.as_view(), name='Update Song'),
    # Deletes a song specified by pk
    path('song/&lt;int:pk&gt;/delete', views.DeleteSong.as_view(), name='Delete Song'),
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a pk that is not an int (you manually defined a pk instead of using the default id generated), you'll have to specify that accordingly.</p>
<p>What if we want more complex behavior beyond the default predefined classes? We can modify them to add more conditions to what is returned.</p>
<p>In this example, we added an optional way to filter songs by album, using a query_param called album. You'll need to read documentation and tutorials if you want to know more about the custom behavior you can define within your Django REST Framework views.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class GetSongInAlbum(generics.ListAPIView):
    serializer_class = SongSerializer
    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = Song.objects.all()
        alb = self.request.query_params.get('album', None)
        queryset = queryset.filter(album=alb)
        return queryset
</code></pre>
<p>If you have a view that isn't necessarily linked to CRUD actions, or has more complex usage and needs more custom defined behavior, you can use APIView. </p>
<h4 id="test-out-your-django-rest-api"><a class="header" href="#test-out-your-django-rest-api">Test out your Django REST API</a></h4>
<p>Compile and run your app with </p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3 manage.py runserver 
</code></pre>
<p>Use your bugfixing wizardry to fix any errors that might show up. Now you should be ready to give those predefined endpoints you made for a spin!</p>
<p>Here's some examples that I did using <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Postman</span></strong> for API testing. If you used Django REST Framework, it should also come with a built-in API testing tool that you can use in your browser.</p>
<p>Here's a simple GET request. This is a database read operation, and it's pretty simple. Your browser is making GET requests to every URL you visit while you surf the web.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Request

  </tr>
</table>
<p>Here's a POST request (it's post because we're _creating _or <em>Posting</em> new data) to our create route. We should include the key-value pairs for the song we want to create in the **_Body _**of our request.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Request

  </tr>
</table>
<p>To update, let's follow the URL pattern we defined with the pk of the song we want to update. We can use PUT or PATCH. The info you're sending should be in the _Body _of the request, just like it was for our POST request.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Request

<p>Let's do the same thing for our deleteSong view, but let's delete Taylor's song this time (pk: 2). I'm sure it was no good anyways. </p>
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Request
   </td>

<p>Let's use our GET view to see what's inside the DB now:</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image4.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image25.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p><em>**unimportant note: in my zeal to delete taylor's song I had a mishap and accidentally deleted song 3, which I have readded here using a post request. but it's id is now 5 :[</em></p>
<p>Finally, let's try out that &quot;song with album&quot; route. We'll add it to our urls.py:</p>
<pre><code>    # Probably not the best naming convention
    path('songInAlbum', views.GetSongInAlbum.as_view(), name='Get song in album'),
</code></pre>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image18.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Here's what our request will look like.  ^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>Here's the response:</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image3.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<pre><code>Good to know: Query Parameters
Notice how our query params don't have to be specified in urls.py - they are dynamically generated from the URL that we try access (everything that comes after a ? in a url is a query parameter, with keys and values separated by '='. If you had multiple query parameters they would be separated by '&amp;'. Next time you're browsing the web, notice how query parameters are used across the different websites you visit!
It's easy to access query params within Django - see the getSongInAlbum view definition for an example.

<h4 id="authtokens-users-logins-with-django-rest-framework"><a class="header" href="#authtokens-users-logins-with-django-rest-framework">Authtokens, users, logins with Django REST Framework</a></h4>
<p>Up to now, we've covered the fundamentals of how to create a database, populate it, and create simple endpoints for creating, updating, and destroying. But what happens when we want our system to be used by real users? How do we store their information and their interactions with our system? There are a few important issues that we'll need to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we make sure that users' personal information like their passcodes are being stored in a secure way that protects them from being stolen?</li>
<li>How do we build a system that users can sign up for and log in to? How do we store info about their session?</li>
<li>How do we make certain endpoints in our system behave differently depending on the user who is accessing them?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to these questions can be complicated. In order to save your time and energy, we're going to utilize the resources that Django and Django REST Framework provide for us as much as possible instead of developing our own solutions. Not only is this easier, but it's also much more secure- would you trust a system written from scratch by a novice undergrad student with your password and financial information?</p>
<p><strong><em>How do we store user's personal info?</em></strong></p>
<p>The answer to this question is usually to use Django's built-in User model. You can read the docs on User models here:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/auth/</a></p>
<p>The User model contains common fields that will be used by users, and in your serializers you can define which fields are relevant to your use case.</p>
<p>By default, Django builds the User models for you. You can see them after you <em>runserver</em> and check inside the /admin route.</p>
<p>We can also utilize the User model to build new endpoints in our API, just like we could with any other model. Here's an example:</p>
<h4 id="modelspy"><a class="header" href="#modelspy">Models.py</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.contrib.auth.models import User
</code></pre>
<p>…</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class UserLikesSong(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    song = models.ForeignKey(Song, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
</code></pre>
<h4 id="serializerspy"><a class="header" href="#serializerspy">Serializers.py</a></h4>
<pre><code>class UserLikesSongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserLikesSong
        fields = (&quot;id&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;song&quot;)
        #Id of the rel, Id of the user, ID of the song
</code></pre>
<p>You can now make endpoints with this just like you would with any other model/serializer. This specific example could be used to track what songs the User likes, like in Spotify. </p>
<p>If you wanted to make a custom User model, you could read more about it here <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html">https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html</a> and do more research, as there are many methods you could use. For basic university usage though, it's 99% of the time going to be faster and easier to roll with the User model they give you out of the box.</p>
<p>If you want to give different categories of users different permissions, see the_ permissions _section (TODO: this won't be done for a while. In the meantime, these links may help: <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/</a> ← Technical overview</p>
<p><a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/4-authentication-and-permissions/</a> ← Basic usage example)</p>
<p><strong><em>Signup, Login, Sessions: How do we do them?</em></strong></p>
<p>I highly recommend using Django REST Framework's Authtokens to handle information about user sessions. You can read about authtokens, as well as the other options available, here: <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication</a></p>
<p>To add Authtoken's, make sure the following items appear in settings.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">###### You will need to add the REST Framework part.
###### INSTALLED_APPS should already exist.

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',  
    ],
}

INSTALLED_APPS = [ # There will be more here
  'rest_framework',
  'rest_framework.authtoken',
]


</code></pre>
<p>Note: I couldn't get these to work, at least not with authtoken. Leaving them here in case some enterprising individual finds them useful, or message us on Discord if you figure this out :)</p>
<p>To get REST Framework's default login and logout views (prebuilt), type this in your project's root urls.py file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"> urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))
]
</code></pre>
<p>Your path doesn't have to be api-auth, it can be whatever you want.</p>
<p>To use REST Framework's login view, include this in urls.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    path('whateverPathYouWantToLogin', obtain_auth_token, name='API Token Login'),
</code></pre>
<p>Include this at top of your urls.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
</code></pre>
<p>When you access this path and provide a real username and password in the request body, then you should receive an authtoken. This authtoken is associated with your account. Store this authtoken in a safe place. Now, you can use it in the &quot;authorization&quot; section of your next HTTP requests, and all requests you make from the client will be associated with the account you just logged in from.</p>
<p>Creating views for signing up is more difficult.</p>

<p>Whenever you see an error like &quot;no such table&quot;, that should be a clue that you need to rerun migrations. The app expected there to be a SQL table, but there was none made yet! Running migrations will ensure there is. Recall the commands for migrations are:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>python3 manage.py makemigrations yourAppName</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>python3 manage.py migrate</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, just the second command will be sufficient</p>

<p>Response:</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image22.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Yay! It worked! Now we can include this token in our request headers to associate all future requests made with the user we logged in.</p>
<p>In future requests, you should put the token as a value in your request headers, using the key: token.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image23.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p><br />
Depending on the front-end you build, you should use a different way to store the authtoken that you get from logging in. Usually storing in local memory is okay. Do your own research for how to store authtokens with whatever system you are using.</p>
<p>If you want to improve security further, you can use JWT (JSON webtoken) instead, following the instructions here: <a href="https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html">https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html</a></p>
<p><strong><em>How do we make endpoints behave differently depending on which user is accessing them?</em></strong></p>
<p>If a user makes a request while they are authenticated (using authtoken, or some other alternative method), then the system will automatically know what user is associated with the user who made the request. </p>
<p>You can access the user within a class-based view through </p>
<pre><code class="language-python"> self.request.user
</code></pre>
<p>You can use this within your views in a variety of ways: to filter, to make more complex queries, and to check if the user should have access. </p>
<p>For example, let's make a UserLikesSong endpoint that is limited to the songs that the currently logged in user has liked.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class GetUserLikesSongs(generics.ListAPIView):
    def get_queryset(self):
        queryset = UserLikesSong.objects.all()
        queryset = queryset.filter(user=self.request.user)
	# Leftside of filter: from queryset. Rightside: how we're filtering
        return queryset
    serializer_class = UserLikesSongSerializer
</code></pre>
<p>We'll cover this in much more detail in the Permissions section.</p>
<h4 id="permissions"><a class="header" href="#permissions">Permissions</a></h4>
<pre><code>NOTE: Everything past here is incomplete - you will need to supplement it with your own research, like I did to make this guide!
</code></pre>
<p>To use generic permissions with Django, all you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your views.py:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser, IsAuthenticated, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly
</code></pre>
<p>Now, on any class-based view you want to guard with permissions, you can add the following line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class deleteLicenseType(generics.DestroyAPIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAdminUser]
    queryset = License_Type.objects.all()
    serializer_class = License_TypeSerializer
</code></pre>
<p>(this is from a different project)</p>
<p>You can apply multiple permissions to the same view like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    permission_classes = [IsAdminUser|IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="sessions--cookies"><a class="header" href="#sessions--cookies">Sessions &amp; Cookies</a></h4>
<p>Sessions/cookies are very easy to make use of with Django. You can use cookies to store information in a user's browser that you'll be able to access in all subsequent requests that a user makes. One example of a good use of sessions/cookies is to store a user's shopping cart content.</p>
<p>Some great videos for learning about sessions &amp; cookies:</p>

<h4 id="deploy-to-heroku"><a class="header" href="#deploy-to-heroku">Deploy to Heroku</a></h4>
<p><img src="guides/Django_Guide/images/image13.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>To get your projects online, you can deploy them to Heroku. Heroku is just one of several possible hosting services for Django- but it's base tier is free, easy to use, and simple to deploy to, so that's what I recommend you use. The biggest downside of using Heroku is that its free tier will automatically shut down your app after a period of downtime, meaning it'll take a long time to respond the next time you try to access it. </p>
<p>A guide on getting started:</p>
<p><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration</a></p>
<p>Some useful commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pip install gunicorn</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To deploy to Heroku, you will need to make a file called Procfile (no file ending), and add the following gunicorn text to it:</p>
<pre><code>web: gunicorn yourAppName.wsgi
</code></pre>
<p>This gunicorn file should be at the same level as your manage.py file. When you deploy to Heroku, you should be deploying from this level of the project hierarchy to avoid issues.</p>
<p>Your remote heroku environment needs to understand what requirements it will need to have to start up. You can do this by providing it with a requirements.txt file which will also be at the same level as your manage.py file.</p>
<p>To get the right requirements in a .txt file, type</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>These commands will help initialize your heroku repository:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heroku create</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heroku run python3 manage.py migrate</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>heroku run python3 manage.py createsuperuser</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Important: Your database itself will not transfer to Heroku. You will need to recreate all entities, config, and users.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started---setting-up-a-repository"><a class="header" href="#getting-started---setting-up-a-repository">Getting Started - Setting up a Repository</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories">GitHub: Create a Repository</a></p>
<p>A Git Repository is virtual storage of your code, allowing you to save versions of your code, as well as share and allow others to edit the code.</p>
<p>Initializing a new repository: <code>git init</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This step is typically used by the project manager, or the owner of the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloning an existing repository: <code>git clone [GitHub git link]</code></p>
<p>E.g. <code>git clone https://github.com/techstartucalgary/tsu-website.git</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This step is typically used by the project members, or anyones who wants to add onto the projects after it has already been created</li>
<li>The GitHub git link can be located on the GitHub repository website under the <code>&lt;&gt; Code</code> dropdown</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-analogy"><a class="header" href="#git-analogy">Git Analogy</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that we have two people working on the same paper remotely, Person A and Person B. Person B is the laziest of the two, so Person A starts the paper.</p>
<p>Person A choses to create a word document on their local machine. This can be seen as <strong>Initializing a new repository.</strong></p>
<p>After working on the paper for a bit, they realize that Person B also needs to contribute, so they send the paper by email to Person B. This step is equivalent to <strong>forking a repository.</strong></p>
<p>Person B decides that they would prefer to work on the paper by hand, and so they takes the email that Person A sent, and prints it to work on, <strong>cloning the repository</strong></p>
<h2 id="gui-vs-command-line"><a class="header" href="#gui-vs-command-line">GUI vs Command Line?</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of great GUI (graphical user interface) tools that simplify the process of
using Git, like GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, and the built-in Source Control tab in VSCode.
There's nothing wrong with using these tools, but we like to encourage our members to use the
command line in order to get a better understanding of what exactly you're doing. It's also universal,
so whatever you learn here can be used in any organization that uses Git!</p>
<h2 id="staging-files--creating-commits"><a class="header" href="#staging-files--creating-commits">Staging Files &amp; Creating Commits</a></h2>
<p>Git works using units of change called <strong><em><code>commits</code></em></strong>. These commits are essentially snapshots of your project. To share any changes, additions, and deletions that you make with other people and upload it to the internet, you will need to package them into a commit first.</p>
<p>You can think of the staging area of git (the green box that says &quot;staged changes&quot; in the below diagram) like a box. You can add and remove changes from the box on a <em>per-file</em> basis.</p>
<p>Committing is like sealing that box and sticking a label on it. The contents of that box are your changes. But, if there are changes in the untracked or unstaged areas, they will not be included in the commit, because they are outside of the box.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows how the staging process works, and what commands you can use to move changes (again, per-file basis) between areas. Use the <code>git status</code> command to see a summary of where every change in your project is on this diagram! We recommend using <code>git status</code> frequently.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Git_Guide/images/image2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h2 id="common-commands"><a class="header" href="#common-commands">Common Commands</a></h2>
<p>Here are some common commands for using Git to store and prepare the code to be pushed to the remote repository.
They are shown in the general order that you want to use them in.</p>
<p>Below is the legend for some common, optional parameters which are shown</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(-text)</strong> = optional parameters for command, which are <strong>called as is</strong> (<code>git command -text</code>)</li>
<li><strong>&lt;helloWorld&gt;</strong> = optional parameters for command, which are <strong>called with your version of the name</strong> (<code>git command helloWorld</code>)</li>
<li>For example: For <code>git add [path]</code>, you should replace <code>[path]</code> with <code>path/to/your/file</code>, so the final command is <code>git add path/to/your/file</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="git-status"><a class="header" href="#git-status"><code>git status</code></a></h3>
<p>Shows the status of all changes (all staged or unstaged changes, not committed changes). It shows where every change is on the diagram above, and even lists some helpful commands.</p>
<p>It will also say what branch you are on, and if you are ahead or behind the remote version of your branch in terms of commits (more on this in later sections).</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have a merge conflict, it will show which files caused it.</p>
<h3 id="git-add-pathtofile"><a class="header" href="#git-add-pathtofile"><code>git add [path/to/file]</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git add app/pages/HomePage.tsx</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selects the specified files, moves it to the “staging area” to be included in the next commit.</p>
<p>This command will also allow adding a deleted file to be staged, which after being committed and pushed will remove the file from the git branch.</p>
<p><strong>This command will ignore all files in the “.gitignore” file</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[path/to/file]</code> File path expression. Any files which match the expression are acted upon by <code>git add</code>
<ul>
<li>You can use <code>git add -p</code> to add parts of a changed file if needed.</li>
<li>Pro tip: You can use <code>git add -A</code> to add all changed files! Read about why <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/git-add#git-add-all-files">you shouldn't always do this</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="git-commit--m-commitmessage"><a class="header" href="#git-commit--m-commitmessage"><code>git commit -m &quot;[commitMessage]&quot;</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git commit -m &quot;Updated homepage text&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creates a new commit that includes <strong>all</strong> changes that you added to the staging area.</p>
<p>You always need to include a commit message (<code>-m</code>) for your commit . It is helpful to be as descriptive as possible!</p>
<p>If you don't use the <code>-m</code> flag and provide a commit message in quotations, Git will make you write a commit message using a text editor. However, this can be very confusing since your default Git text editor is often configured to be VIM (stuck in VIM? type <code>:qa</code> to exit). For this reason, we recommend always specifying the commit message using <code>-m</code>.</p>
<p>After you commit, these changes are no longer in the staging area - they are in your commit!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(<code>-m</code>) means you will be specifying a commit message in quotations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;[commitMessage]&quot;</code> the message that will be attached to the commit. Only usable if <code>-m</code> is used, otherwise a text editor will appear for the commit message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tip: always wrap your message in double quotes (<code>&quot;</code>). This lets you use abbrevations in your message (<code>... -m &quot;Reverted Ben's Changes&quot;</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="git-restore-pathtofile"><a class="header" href="#git-restore-pathtofile"><code>git restore [path/to/file]</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git restore app/pages/HomePage.tsx</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discards local changes in a file, thereby restoring its last committed state.</p>
<p>Think of it like a super-undo, allowing you to quickly get rid of accidental or unnecessary changes, restoring your files to how they used to be before you changed them.</p>
<p>It won't work if your file is already staged - you'll have to unstage it with <code>git restore --staged [path/to/file]</code> first.</p>
<h3 id="git-restore---staged-pathtofile"><a class="header" href="#git-restore---staged-pathtofile"><code>git restore --staged [path/to/file]</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git restore --staged app/pages/HomePage.tsx</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removes the file from the Staging Area, but preserve all modifications you made to it.
You can use it if you accidentally added a file to the staging area whose changes shouldn't be included as part of the next commit you are planning to make.
If the file was originally untracked, it becomes untracked again. If it was originally a file with unstaged changes, the changes become unstaged again.</p>
<h3 id="naming-commits"><a class="header" href="#naming-commits">Naming commits</a></h3>
<p>When you create a commit, you always want to include a descriptive name for the commit that describes exactly what it accomplishes. You wouldn’t label a moving box with kitchen items as simply “stuff”.
Remember that other people will see these commit names, so make it easy for them to understand!</p>

<p>If you want to learn about additional flags and commands you can use in the process of staging files and adding commits, see the section <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#advanced-staging-and-commits">Advanced Staging &amp; Commits</a></p>
<h2 id="branches"><a class="header" href="#branches">Branches</a></h2>
<p>Branches represent an independent copy of the code that has <em>branched</em> off the main code at a certain time.
They allow new features to be worked on, while ensuring that a working version of the code is not tampered with.
This allows large changes to be made to the code base, with little fear of breaking your projects.</p>
<h3 id="git-branch"><a class="header" href="#git-branch"><code>git branch</code></a></h3>
<p>Lists all branches in the current repository</p>
<h3 id="git-branch-branchname"><a class="header" href="#git-branch-branchname"><code>git branch [branchName]</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git branch ben/updateFont</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creates a branch called <code>branchName</code> in the current repository.</p>
<p>The created branch's commit history will match the branch you were on when you called <code>git branch</code>.</p>
<p>We recommend naming branches according to what you want your branch to do, prefixed by your name.
For example, if I was updating the font on a website, I might call my branch <code>ben/updateFont</code>.
Since branch names include whitespace, we recommend using camelCase to name them, but check with your PM
how they want to handle this.</p>
<h3 id="git-branch--d-branchname"><a class="header" href="#git-branch--d-branchname"><code>git branch -d [branchName]</code></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git branch -d ben/updateFont</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deletes the branch called <code>branchName</code></p>
<p>Note: you <strong>cannot</strong> delete the branch you are one! <code>git checkout</code> to another branch first.</p>
<p>(You can use <code>-D</code> instead of <code>-d</code> to force delete the specified branch, even is it has unmerged changes.
It's typically better to use <code>-d</code>, unless you are 100% sure you will never need the branch you are deleting again)</p>
<h3 id="git-checkout-branchname"><a class="header" href="#git-checkout-branchname"><code>git checkout [branchName]</code></a></h3>
<p>Navigates your current directory to the specified branch, allows you to select which line of development you are working on.</p>
<p>You can only switch branches if you have no unstaged/staged changes in your current branch. If you can't switch branches because of this, see <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#what-happens-if-you-cant-checkout">What happens if you can't checkout?</a> for more instructions.</p>
<p>Pro tip: You can use <code>git checkout -b [branchName]</code> to create a branch and switch to it immediately.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-branches"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-branches">How to use branches</a></h3>
<p>Some rules (more like guidelines):</p>
<ul>
<li>Every single time you start modifying the code you should create a new branch to use</li>
<li>Branches should generally only be for one feature</li>
<li>Always branch off <code>main</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you make your branch, you should make sure you are creating your branch based on the most recent code. Do <code>git checkout main</code> to switch to the primary branch of your repository. You should also do <code>git pull</code> to make sure the primary branch is up to date with the version present on your remote repository (more on this in the next section).</p>
<p>Now that you are on the primary branch, use <code>git branch [branchName]</code> to create a new branch based on the current one. Make sure you name it according to what you aim to accomplish there (see the description of the command above).</p>
<p>Now that you have created your branch, you'll want to switch to it. Use <code>git checkout [branchName]</code> to switch to your branch. You can do work here and follow the instructions in the staging files and creating commits section to save your changes into commits.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll be done using the branch (perhaps you will follow the instructions in the next few sections to push it to your remote repository and use it in a pull request. or perhaps you need to work somewhere else). Either way, you can switch to a different branch with <code>git checkout [branchName]</code></p>
<p>If you have completed a pull request for your branch to merge it into a different branch of your project, you no longer need to keep the local copy of your branch. We recommend you use <code>git branch -d</code> to delete any branches you will no longer need to use. This makes sure your local repository remains nice and tidy.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of the commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout main
git pull
git branch ben/updateFont
git checkout ben/updateFont
... doing stuff ...
git checkout main
git branch -d ben/updateFont
</code></pre>
<p><img src="guides/Git_Guide/images/branchDiagram.png" alt="Git Branch Diagram" /></p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-you-cant-checkout"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-if-you-cant-checkout">What happens if you can't checkout?</a></h4>
<p>Git will not let you checkout to switch branches if you have staged or unstaged changes.</p>
<p>You will have a few choices on what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restore files to how they originally were (either by manually undoing, or ideally making use of <code>git restore</code>, described in the previous section). Do this if any of your changes are unnecessary or accidental.</li>
<li>Create a commit, following instructions from the previous section. <strong>Only create a commit if you actually want to save the changes you made</strong>.
<ul>
<li>We recommend you <em>avoid making commits on any branches that you share with other people</em>, especially your primary branch (<code>main</code>)! All Tech Start repositories actually prohibit commits to <code>main</code> to prevent this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Utilize <code>git stash</code> to move changes from one branch to another without needing to commit them. Do this if your changes are intentional, but you wanted them on a different branch than the one you are currently on. This is described in more detail <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#git-stash">here.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can combine these approaches to deal with your changes as necessary.</p>
<h2 id="remote-repositories"><a class="header" href="#remote-repositories">Remote Repositories</a></h2>
<p>When you work with Git, you will typically have a <strong><em>local repository</em></strong> (the copy of your project that exists on your personal device) and a <strong><em>remote repository</em></strong> (the copy of your project that exists on the internet, usually on a service like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket)</p>
<p>An absolutely core part of using Git is managing the interactions between your local repository and the associated remote repository. The two key commands you will need to learn are <code>git push</code> (which you can use to <em>push</em> commits from your local repository to the remote repository)
and <code>git pull</code> (which you can use to <em>pull</em> commits from the remote repository and insert them into your own local repository).</p>
<p>A common mistake that newcomers to Git will make is assuming that the local repository is the same as the remote repository - when they're actually 2 separate concepts. Your commits won't appear on the remote repository until you manually push them there. If someone else pushes new changes to the remote repository, you won't see their changes on your local repository until you manually pull those changes to your device.</p>
<p>Most version control related work happens in a local repository(staging, committing, viewing status, etc.).
Remote repositories come into play when you start working with others on the same project.
You can think of it as a cloud file server that you use to collaborate with others.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Git_Guide/images/image5.png" alt="Remotes" /></p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note: You can name a local branch the same name as the remote branch, but they are NOT the same</p>
<p>Note: You can also have multiple remote repositories (default is <code>origin</code>), though you probably won't need this,
since each local repository stores what it's remote is.</p>
<p><code>git fetch</code> is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. It doesn’t force you to actually merge the changes into your repository. This makes fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with your local repository.</p>
<p>You might be wondering how to set a remote, and the good news is that if you cloned your repository from GitHub,
it's been set for you, so no need to worry!
If you need to change the remote for some reason, you can do <code>git remote set-url origin &lt;url&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>git pull origin ben/updateFont</code></p>
<p>Pulls all changes/commits from the specified remote branch, and inserts them into your current branch.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Use <code>git pull</code> without any other options to update the branch you're on. You'll most likely only use this to update <code>main</code>.</p>

<h2 id="merge-conflicts"><a class="header" href="#merge-conflicts">Merge Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it. In these cases, Git doesn't know which change is correct. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process. It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Although they look scary, resolving merge conflicts is a completely normal part of working collaboratively.</p>
<p>The general steps for resolving merge conflicts can be seen as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out the conflicts and change them accordingly</li>
<li>Re-commit the changes</li>
<li>Attempt to merge with the selected branches</li>

<p>In this case, there are two instances of the file “merge.text” that were modified by different branches/people. Git is unable to determine which lines to keep, as both were changed manually.</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify Conflicted Files</li>
</ol>
<p>Git will notify you if there are any merge conflicts after running <code>git status</code>. You can identify these conflicts by looking at your project files. Conflicted files will have markers like <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [branch name]</code> where the conflicting changes are.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Open the Conflicted File</li>
</ol>
<p>Use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) like VS Code to open the conflicted file. Inside, you will see the conflicting sections clearly marked by symbols.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Resolve Conflicts</li>
</ol>
<p>Review the conflicting sections and decide which changes to keep. You can choose to keep your changes, the incoming changes from the other branch, or a combination of both. Make your edits, then remove the conflict markers (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-git"> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD

<p>After resolving all conflicts, use <code>git commit</code> to finalize the merge.</p>
<p><code>git commit -m &quot;Resolved merge conflicts&quot;</code></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Push Your Changes</li>
</ol>
<p><code>git push</code> your changes to the remote repository.</p>
<hr />
<p>Merge conflicts can be complicated to resolve, so make sure you communicate with the person who created
the branch you have a conflict with to ensure you don't lose their work.</p>
<p>Remember that <code>Incoming</code> changes are from the other branch, while <code>Current</code> changes are from your branch.</p>
<p>It also doesn't hurt to use a tool that's purpose-built to resolve merge conflicts.
VS Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_3way-merge-editor">has one built in</a>, but there are a number of free options available online.</p>
<h2 id="using-github"><a class="header" href="#using-github">Using GitHub</a></h2>
<p>GitHub is a company that provides a service of hosting Git repositories online. There are many other alternative companies that provide a similar service, like BitBucket, GitLab, and Azure DevOps, but GitHub is the most popular one and the one our project teams use.</p>
<p>The instructions for the rest of this section will focus on GitHub's features. However, almost every feature described here has equivalents in the other git hosts, so if you know how to use one you generally know how to use them all.</p>
<h3 id="pull-requests"><a class="header" href="#pull-requests">Pull requests</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VX1ISk9XH8&amp;ab_channel=GitKraken">Video intro to pull requests</a></p>
<p>A pull request is a way of merging code from one branch of your <em>remote</em> repository into another.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Git_Guide/images/image3.png" alt="alt_text" /></p>
<p>You are <em>requesting</em> that the <em>base</em> branch <em>pulls</em> the commits from the <em>compare</em> branch.
In the above example, you are requesting that the main branch pulls the commits from the addLaunchEvent.
In other words, you are taking the changes from compare and putting them into base.</p>
<p>You will use pull requests extensively as part of your Git workflow.</p>
<p>We encourage teams to use small, frequent, single-feature PRs. Ideally each PR should be associated with only one branch, and each branch to only one PR. Each PR should have a name that describes exactly what the PR accomplishes. By doing smaller PRs, you will make sure everyone frequently updates their codebase so you don't end up with massive merge conflicts. By limiting your PR to a single feature, you also make it super easy to roll back that feature and reverse all commits in the PR by reverting the PR itself.</p>
<p>Advantages of pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>They enable your team to do pull request reviews (see more below)</li>
<li>Your team can set up custom tests / deployments using CI/CD methods to ensure that your code runs as expected before you merge it</li>
<li>It enables you to double check what code you are adding</li>
<li>If you ever need to undo a pull request, it's very easy. Most git hosts have an easy way of reverting a pull request- usually it will create a new branch and PR itself, from which you can solve any merge conflicts and quickly roll back the code added from a previous PR.</li>
<li>If you stick to coding 1 feature per pull request, it makes it very easy to understand the history of your repository</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, when you create a pull request, it will say there is a merge conflict. If this happens, don't force the PR to merge! Instead, you'll want to resolve the merge conflict.</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your local machine, checkout to the &quot;compare&quot; branch - <code>git checkout addLaunchEvent</code></li>
<li>Once you are on the compare branch, do a git pull from the base branch of your PR - <code>git pull origin main</code></li>
<li>This will pull changes from the base into your compare branch. Git will notify you that this caused a merged conflict. This is okay!</li>
<li>Resolve the merge conflict according to the instructions in the <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#merge-conflicts">Merge Conflicts section</a>. You'll need to add and commit the files where you solved the merge conflict.</li>
<li>Confirm you have resolved every merge conflict. Try running/building your app again to make sure everything works as expected.</li>
<li>Push the commit(s) that solved the merge conflict to your remote compare branch <code>git push origin addLaunchEvent</code></li>
<li>The pull request should now update saying there is no merge conflict! You can merge it now, as long as your team approves of it.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pull-request-reviews"><a class="header" href="#pull-request-reviews">Pull Request Reviews</a></h3>
<p>One of the main advantages of pull requests is that they enable you to do a pull request review, ensuring that code that gets pulled into your primary branches has been reviewed by your team to make sure it won't introduce code smells or bugs.</p>
<p>PRs provide the opportunity to review another developer's code and make sure that it meets the guidelines or practices that your organization or team has. For example, if you have a developer who is more familiar with the architecture of the software system, they can provide valuable input towards making sure that your changes fit within the long term architectural vision of the system.
Alternatively, you can have a newer team member who is not yet familiar with the overall code structure and they can add comments to specific parts of the code in a PR to ask for further clarification for why a certain change was made.</p>
<p>Aside from learning, PRs generally serve as a major communication channel for developers in industry, because they provide the opportunity for automated testing and improvements before your code changes are moved to the next deployment stages. One example of automated testing is using linter which is a static code analysis tool used to flag errors in your code such as bugs, stylistics errors, and suspicious constructs, like for example declaring a variable twice.</p>
<p>Whenever someone wants to merge a pull request, you should require them to get their PR reviewed first. To review a pull request, look at all the changes they made.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices for PR Contributors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review your own PR before adding reviewers.
<ul>
<li>You may find some work-in-progress or experimental code. There could also be a typo, unintended indentation, or extra line breaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Link your PR to your issue.</li>
<li>Include a brief description of your changes.</li>
<li>Push small incremental commits to your PR.
<ul>
<li>You can also mark your PR as a DRAFT PR in GitHub. This pre-commit review can be good practice to check with reviewers if you are going in the right direction before making any more code changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add additional comments to your PR to guide reviewers through the review.
<ul>
<li>Highlight areas reviewers should focus on.</li>
<li>Clarify changes with comments and additional references.</li>
<li>Favor adding code comments over PR comments as the code comments will out survive the PR comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-reviewers"><a class="header" href="#best-practices-for-reviewers">Best Practices for Reviewers</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Be fast, not furious
<ul>
<li>Responsiveness and turnaround time are very important to keep PRs healthy and not go stale due to other changes which may have been merged during the time that the PR is open and may even introduce new merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Either as a reviewer or as an author, you should keep the conversation actively going until the issue is resolved.</li>
<li>As a rule of thumb, if the PR is small or trivial, you should review it within one business day.</li>
<li>Plus, context switching is very expensive in industry. Many developers, like myself, have the memory of a goldfish when it comes to remembering the code we wrote a day ago. So, as a courtesy, you can let the developer who opened the PR know if you are planning on looking at their PR at a later time. If there are PRs open, it is also good practice to review them before you create a new one yourself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If there are outstanding comments or the PR is in draft mode, do not approve the PR.
<ul>
<li>Instead, stay involved and follow the discussions and new changes to see how the PR pans out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do NOT rubber stamp reviews.
<ul>
<li>If you do not understand a change, you can ask for clarification or justification in the comments.</li>
<li>You do not have to approve a PR if you are not actually approving the change. You can let the author know that you have completed your review but are not weighing in on the approval.</li>
<li>Our TechStart website team's default PR policy requires approvals from 2 different reviewers, but an approval that is rubber stamped can be more harmful than abstaining if it promotes bad practices and bugs to be user-facing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide constructive comments
<ul>
<li>Code reviews are an important step in ensuring we build high-quality software products. As a reviewer, it's your job to carefully read and think about the code you are reviewing, and provide constructive feedback or ask questions about the code if things are unclear.</li>
<li>If the code isn't formatted correctly, too confusing, contains mistakes, or follows poor conventions, leave a comment to tell them what they did wrong and how they might be able to fix it (but phrase everything constructively! you don't want to seem rude or aggressive).</li>
<li><strong>If you disagree with something, give a reason and an example of a better solution. Let the author know exactly what you think is better.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>GitHub and other Git hosts support adding inline comments, so you can comment on specific areas of the code when necessary. The best place to do this is the &quot;Files Changed&quot; tab of a pull request.</p>
<p>It is up to them to address every issue that is brought up, and push the changes back to their branch. They should let you know when they've completed everything, and you can check to make sure you're happy with their changes.</p>
<h2 id="our-recommended-git-workflow"><a class="header" href="#our-recommended-git-workflow">Our recommended Git workflow</a></h2>
<p>Let's assume you have some commits on branch <code>yourLocalBranch</code>, and you want to merge them into a branch on your team's GitHub (which uses the default remote alias, <code>origin</code>) called <code>branchYouWantToMergeTo</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 - Set up your branch</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you are on the main branch of your repository. It is usually called <code>main</code>. If you are not on the <code>main</code> branch, switch to it with <code>git checkout main</code></li>
<li>Pull the most recent version of your main branch from GitHub. You can do this with <code>git pull origin main</code>. This will make sure your new branch contains all the most recent changes</li>
<li>Create a new branch for yourself. The name of the branch should describe what the code inside will do, and you should prefix it with your name or nickname. For example, <code>git branch joel/changeButtonColor</code></li>
<li>Check out your new branch before you make any changes. Example: <code>git checkout joel/changeButtonColor</code>. Refer to <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#branches">Branches</a> if you make any mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 2 - Make your commits</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#staging-files--creating-commits">Staging Files and Adding Commits</a> section to create a commit containing your desired changes. Use <code>git status</code> frequently to make sure you are doing everything correctly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 3 - Push your commits to origin</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push your branch to origin. Ex. <code>git push origin joel/changeButtonColor</code></li>
<li>Set up a pull request on GitHub, with the base as main (or the branch you want to merge to) and the compare branch as your branch, (ex joel/changeButtonColor)</li>
<li>(Only if your pull request indicates you have a merge conflict): DO NOT merge the branch. Instead, do <code>git pull origin main</code> (or the branch you want to merge to) on your local machine. This will bring up the merge conflict.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions in <a href="guides/Git_Guide/index.html#merge-conflicts">Merge Conflicts</a> to fix any merge conflicts that you get from pulling that branch. Once you have fixed all merge conflicts, remember to double check that your code runs, then <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> your fixes!</li>
<li>Push your changes to your remote repository! Do <code>git push origin yourLocalBranch</code></li>
<li>Now that your changes are present on your remote repository, you should create a pull request on GitHub. The base (target branch) should be <code>branchYouWantToMergeTo</code>, and the source should be <code>yourLocalBranch</code>.</li>
<li>Check to make sure the pull request says &quot;No merge conflicts&quot;. If it does detect merge conflicts, that means you didn't do steps 4-7 correctly, so redo them!</li>
<li>Request a reviewer for your pull request. They will read your code and offer suggestions on how to improve it.</li>
<li>Resolve the comments of your reviewer. Once they are resolved and your reviewer confirms you can proceed, you can merge the pull request on GitHub. Congratulations! Your code is now merged into your project.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clean up</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete your branch on the remote repository</li>
<li>Delete your branch on your local system (checkout to main. Then delete with <code>git branch -d yourBranchName</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="big-picture-gitgithub-workflow"><a class="header" href="#big-picture-gitgithub-workflow">Big Picture Git/GitHub Workflow</a></h2>
<p>Now that you understand the complete process on an individual level, let's take a step back to understand how your team will be using git.</p>
<p>Here is the Git workflow we recommend:</p>
<p><em>This is what is used at Microsoft. It works well and it's good practice to teach it</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a team member wants to make changes or additions to the code, they should create a new branch for themselves. The branch name should describe what it does, ex. <code>fixButtonGlitch</code></li>
<li>They <code>git push</code> their code to a branch on your origin repo that shares the same name</li>
<li>When they're ready, they create a Pull Request on GitHub. The PR's source should be their branch, and the destination should be <code>main</code>.</li>
<li>They should describe their Pull Request in the description and provide screenshots if applicable</li>
<li>They merge their own PR, once the following 3 conditions are met:
<ol>
<li>There are no merge conflicts with the base branch</li>
<li>If your project has Continuous Integration (which it should), the PR build succeeds</li>
<li>At least 2 people have reviewed the code in the PR (more on code reviews later) and all comments from code reviews have been resolved</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Upon merging the PR, they delete their branch.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some advanced Git commands you can use to boost your Git game to the next level. They are not essential to using Git, but you may find them helpful. If you're still learning the beginner commands, we recommend focusing on them until you're comfortable with them before worrying about these advanced commands.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-staging-and-commits"><a class="header" href="#advanced-staging-and-commits">Advanced Staging and Commits</a></h3>
<p>Here are some additional commands and flags for existing commands that you can use while you are staging files and adding commits.</p>

<h3 id="git-add-filename-or-foldername--u"><a class="header" href="#git-add-filename-or-foldername--u"><code>git add [fileName or folderName] (-u)</code></a></h3>
<p>You can use the <code>-u</code> flag on <code>git add</code> for the following effects:</p>
<p>(<code>-u</code>) adds new/modified files and IGNORES deleted files to the staging area</p>
<h3 id="git-commit--a--am-commit-message-here"><a class="header" href="#git-commit--a--am-commit-message-here"><code>git commit (-a) (-am) &quot;[Commit message here]&quot;</code></a></h3>
<p>You can use the <code>-a</code> and <code>-am</code> flags on <code>git</code> commit for the following effects:</p>
<p>(<code>-a</code>) commits all files in the staging area</p>
<p>(<code>-am</code>) commits all files in the staging area and allows the addition of the commit message in the command</p>
<p><code>&quot;[Commit message here]&quot;</code> the message that will be attached to the commit. Only usable if <code>-m</code> or <code>-am</code> is used; otherwise, a text editor will appear for the commit message.</p>

<p><img src="guides/API_Guide/images/image1.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>APIs are a ubiquitous component of software engineering. APIs allow different components of a software system to interact with each other in a logical way.</p>
<p>Learning about APIs is critical to your growth as a software developer. This guide contains links and advice to get you started!</p>
<h2 id="introduction-3"><a class="header" href="#introduction-3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>What is an API?</p>
<p><img src="guides/API_Guide/images/image3.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface, and in simple words, allows two applications to talk to each other and send information between the two.</p>
<p>Further reading on the basics of APIs: <a href="https://www.plektonlabs.com/api-101-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhf2MBhDNARIsAKXU5GRbLqWDWBPN0Zh4ZX6KwjevURl9KmQo0EVBzLn5mcePxaI_l1oWQSQaAkGDEALw_wcB">https://www.plektonlabs.com/api-101-what-are-they-and-how-do-they-work/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhf2MBhDNARIsAKXU5GRbLqWDWBPN0Zh4ZX6KwjevURl9KmQo0EVBzLn5mcePxaI_l1oWQSQaAkGDEALw_wcB</a> </p>
<p>Analogy of an API</p>
<p>Imagine you are sitting in a restaurant with a menu and you are trying to decide what to order. You are one of the applications and in order to get food, the kitchen will act like the other application. It is the system that will “make” you food. The waiter in this scenario will be the API, and he/she delivers the food from one application(the kitchen) to another(you). The waiter is the messenger that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.</p>
<p>How API’s Work</p>
<ol>
<li>A client application initiates an API call to retrieve information—also known as a request. This request is processed from an application to the web server via the API’s Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and includes a request verb(see Types of API calls), headers, and sometimes, a request body.</li>
<li>After receiving a valid request, the API makes a call to the external program or web server.</li>
<li>The server sends a response to the API with the requested information.</li>
<li>The API transfers the data to the initial application that requested the information.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why would you need an API?</p>
<p>Many companies have APIs built to allow others to build interesting applications using their company data. APIs also allows a project to be dynamic - it will update the frontend information automatically when the back end is updated. This saves the hassle of going through tons of HTML code updating data one by one.</p>

<h2 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components <a name="components"></a></a></h2>
<p>React is built around the concept of components. Components are reusable, self-contained units that encapsulate the UI and behavior of a part of the application. React applications are typically composed of many components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function MyComponent() {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="jsx"><a class="header" href="#jsx">JSX <a name="jsx"></a></a></h2>
<p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. It's used in React to define the structure of components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rendering"><a class="header" href="#rendering">Rendering <a name="rendering"></a></a></h2>
<p>React renders components into the DOM (Document Object Model). You can use the <code>ReactDOM</code> library to render a component into a specific HTML element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">ReactDOM.render(&lt;MyComponent /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="props"><a class="header" href="#props">Props <a name="props"></a></a></h2>
<p>Props (short for properties) allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component. This enables you to create dynamic and reusable components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Greeting(props) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="state"><a class="header" href="#state">State <a name="state"></a></a></h2>
<p>State is a way to store and manage data that can change over time. It is used to make components dynamic and interactive.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="lifecycle-methods"><a class="header" href="#lifecycle-methods">Lifecycle Methods <a name="lifecycle-methods"></a></a></h2>
<p>React components have a lifecycle, and you can use lifecycle methods to perform actions at various stages of a component's existence. For example, <code>componentDidMount</code> is called after a component is rendered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">componentDidMount() {
  // Perform initialization after rendering.
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="handling-events"><a class="header" href="#handling-events">Handling Events <a name="handling-events"></a></a></h2>
<p>You can define event handlers in React components to respond to user interactions, such as clicks or input changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }

  return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conditional-rendering"><a class="header" href="#conditional-rendering">Conditional Rendering <a name="conditional-rendering"></a></a></h2>
<p>You can use conditional statements and expressions to conditionally render different parts of a component based on certain conditions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Greeting(props) {
  if (props.isLoggedIn) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Welcome, User!&lt;/div&gt;;
  } else {
    return &lt;div&gt;Please log in.&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="lists-and-keys"><a class="header" href="#lists-and-keys">Lists and Keys <a name="lists-and-keys"></a></a></h2>
<p>React provides a way to render lists of elements efficiently and assigns unique keys to each item in the list for optimization.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt; &lt;li key={number}&gt;{number}&lt;/li&gt;);
</code></pre>
<p>React utilizes several JavaScript features and concepts like arrow functions, classes, callbacks, promises, and async/await to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Let's explore each of these in detail and discuss how they are related and integrated in React:</p>
<h1 id="javascript-for-react"><a class="header" href="#javascript-for-react">Javascript For React: <a name="javascript-for-react"></a></a></h1>
<p>Arrow functions, classes, callbacks, promises, and async/await are fundamental JavaScript concepts that are commonly used in React. Let's explore each of these topics and how they are related and integrated in React:</p>
<h2 id="arrow-functions"><a class="header" href="#arrow-functions">Arrow Functions: <a name="arrow-functions"></a></a></h2>
<p>Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are commonly used in React for defining components and functions, as they have a more compact syntax compared to traditional function expressions. Arrow functions capture the <code>this</code> value of the enclosing context automatically, making them suitable for working within React components and event handlers.</p>
<p>Example of an arrow function defining a React component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const MyComponent = () =&gt; {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;;
};
</code></pre>
<h2 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes: <a name="classes"></a></a></h2>
<p>Classes in JavaScript are used to define and create objects with methods and properties. In React, components are often defined as classes, especially when they need to manage component state and lifecycle methods. React class components extend the <code>React.Component</code> class and can have methods like <code>render</code>, <code>componentDidMount</code>, and more for handling component behavior.</p>
<p>Example of a React class component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;div&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>**Note on functional versus class-based components**</code></p>
<p>When React was first created, class-based components were the standard. But functional components were introduced later, and they eclipse class-based components in every way.</p>
<p><em>Our advice: Ironically, you should probably never use class-based components!</em></p>
<p>Stick to functional components. They are more modern and more versatile.</p>
<p>Lots of tutorial content online still uses class-based components. If you stumble upon a tutorial or explanation that uses a class-based component, and you're new to React, please search for a functional-component alternative instead!</p>
<h2 id="callbacks"><a class="header" href="#callbacks">Callbacks: <a name="callbacks"></a></a></h2>
<p>Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a later time or in response to an event. React uses callbacks extensively, especially in event handling. For example, you can pass callback functions to event handlers to respond to user interactions.</p>
<p>Example of a callback function for handling a button click:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function handleClick() {
  console.log('Button clicked');
}

&lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="promises"><a class="header" href="#promises">Promises: <a name="promise"></a></a></h2>
<p>Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or never. Promises have three states: <code>pending</code>, <code>fulfilled</code>, and <code>rejected</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating Promises:</strong>
You can create a promise using the <code>Promise</code> constructor. It takes a function with two arguments: <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code>. You typically perform an asynchronous operation in this function and call <code>resolve</code> when the operation is successful or <code>reject</code> when it fails.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (operationSucceeded) {
    resolve(result);
  } else {
    reject(error);
  }
});
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chaining Promises:</strong>
Promises can be chained together using <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code> to handle the resolved value or errors. This chaining allows you to compose complex asynchronous operations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">myPromise
  .then((result) =&gt; {
    // Handle success
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    // Handle error
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#asyncawait"><code>async/await</code>: <a name="awaitasync"></a></a></h2>
<p><code>async</code> and <code>await</code> are modern JavaScript features for working with asynchronous code. They make asynchronous code more readable and maintainable.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>async</code> Function:</strong>
An <code>async</code> function is a function that always returns a promise. It allows you to use the <code>await</code> keyword inside the function to pause execution until the promise is resolved.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return data.json();
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>await</code> Keyword:</strong>
The <code>await</code> keyword can only be used inside an <code>async</code> function. It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved, and it returns the resolved value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = await myPromise;
// The code here will not execute until myPromise is resolved.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="promises-and-aysncawait-integration-in-react"><a class="header" href="#promises-and-aysncawait-integration-in-react">Promises and Aysnc/Await Integration in React:</a></h2>
<p>React applications often involve asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs or making network requests. Promises, <code>async/await</code>, and React's lifecycle methods can be integrated for managing asynchronous tasks effectively:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fetching Data:</strong>
You can use <code>async/await</code> to fetch data in React components. Typically, you do this inside <code>componentDidMount()</code> or within functional components using the <code>useEffect</code> hook.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">async componentDidMount() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    this.setState({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating Component State:</strong>
Once the data is fetched, you can update the component state to trigger a re-render with the new data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Errors:</strong>
Use <code>try/catch</code> to handle errors gracefully. You can also integrate error boundaries in React to catch errors in the component tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Promises:</strong>
React works well with Promises, and you can use <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code> to manage asynchronous operations. However, <code>async/await</code> is often preferred for its more readable and synchronous-like syntax.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating Promises and <code>async/await</code> in React allows you to manage asynchronous operations in a clean and structured way, providing a better user experience by preventing UI blocking during data retrieval.</p>

<h2 id="events-in-react"><a class="header" href="#events-in-react">Events in React <a name="events"></a></a></h2>
<h3 id="event-handling"><a class="header" href="#event-handling">Event Handling</a></h3>
<p>In React, events are used to capture and respond to user interactions, such as clicks, input changes, and mouse movements. Event handling in React is similar to handling events in traditional HTML, but there are some differences due to React's synthetic event system.</p>
<p>In React, you define event handlers as functions and attach them to JSX elements using event attributes. Here's an example of how you might handle a click event in React:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }

  return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>onClick</code> attribute specifies the event handler function, <code>handleClick</code>, which will be executed when the button is clicked. React's synthetic event system provides a consistent API for handling events across different browsers.</p>
<h3 id="event-object"><a class="header" href="#event-object">Event Object</a></h3>
<p>In React, event handlers are passed an event object as an argument. This object contains information about the event, such as the type of event, target element, and any event-specific data. You can access event properties and methods within your event handler functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function handleChange(event) {
  console.log('Input value:', event.target.value);
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="higher-order-components-hocs-in-react"><a class="header" href="#higher-order-components-hocs-in-react">Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React <a name="higher-order-components"></a></a></h2>
<h3 id="what-are-hocs"><a class="header" href="#what-are-hocs">What Are HOCs?</a></h3>
<p>Higher Order Components are a design pattern in React that allows you to reuse component logic by wrapping one or more components with a higher-order component. HOCs are not a part of the React API; they are a pattern that leverages the composability of components.</p>
<h3 id="how-hocs-work"><a class="header" href="#how-hocs-work">How HOCs Work</a></h3>
<p>HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new enhanced component. They can add props, modify behavior, or encapsulate certain functionality. For example, you might create an HOC that provides authentication, access control, or data fetching capabilities to a component.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified example of a higher order component that provides a &quot;loading&quot; indicator to a component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function withLoadingIndicator(WrappedComponent) {
  return function WithLoadingIndicator(props) {
    if (props.isLoading) {
      return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
    }
    return &lt;WrappedComponent {...props} /&gt;;
  };
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-hocs"><a class="header" href="#using-hocs">Using HOCs</a></h3>
<p>You can use an HOC by wrapping your component with it. For instance, suppose you have a component called <code>MyComponent</code>, and you want to add a loading indicator using the <code>withLoadingIndicator</code> HOC:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoadingIndicator(MyComponent);
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>MyComponentWithLoading</code> is a new component that includes the loading indicator logic from the HOC. You can render it as you would with any other component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;MyComponentWithLoading isLoading={true} /&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="benefits-of-hocs"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-hocs">Benefits of HOCs</a></h3>
<p>HOCs enable you to separate concerns and promote reusability. They help you avoid code duplication by encapsulating common functionality in a separate function. This makes your code more maintainable and flexible, allowing you to compose and extend component behavior as needed.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-between-events-and-hocs"><a class="header" href="#relationship-between-events-and-hocs">Relationship Between Events and HOCs</a></h3>
<p>Events and HOCs can work together in a React application. For instance, you might create an HOC that handles common event-related logic, such as tracking user interactions, and then wrap components that need that behavior. This can help centralize event handling logic and make it reusable across multiple components. Additionally, you can pass event handling functions as props when composing components with HOCs, allowing for flexible customization of event behavior.</p>
<p>In summary, events in React are essential for capturing and responding to user interactions, while Higher Order Components are a design pattern that promotes reusability and composability of component logic. You can use HOCs to encapsulate and extend event-related logic, making it easier to manage event handling across your React application.</p>
<h2 id="props-vs-state"><a class="header" href="#props-vs-state">Props vs. State <a name="props-vs-state"></a></a></h2>
<p>Props and state are two fundamental concepts in React, and they play distinct roles in how components work.</p>
<h3 id="props-1"><a class="header" href="#props-1">Props</a></h3>
<p><strong>Props (short for properties)</strong> are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only, meaning that the child component cannot modify the props it receives. They are used to customize or configure child components based on data from their parent.</p>
<p>Example of using props:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Greeting(props) {
  return &lt;div&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/div&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="state-1"><a class="header" href="#state-1">State</a></h3>
<p><strong>State</strong> is a way to store and manage data that can change over time within a component. State is used to make components dynamic and interactive. Unlike props, state is mutable, and components can change their internal state using the <code>setState</code> method. State is often used for data that the component needs to keep track of, such as user input or UI state.</p>
<p>Example of using state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Count: {this.state.count}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}&gt;
          Increment
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-they-relate-and-are-integrated"><a class="header" href="#how-they-relate-and-are-integrated">How They Relate and Are Integrated</a></h2>
<p>Props and state are often used together to create dynamic and interactive React applications. Here's how they relate and are integrated:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Passing Data</strong>: Props are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components. This data can be initial data that a child component uses to render itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating Data</strong>: State is used to manage data that can change within a component. Components can have state and use it to keep track of user interactions, input, or changes in data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reactivity</strong>: When a parent component passes props to a child component, any changes to those props in the parent will re-render the child. This allows for dynamic updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State Management</strong>: State is local to the component that owns it, and changes in state trigger re-renders of that component, updating the UI as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifting State</strong>: Sometimes, you might need to manage state at a higher level in the component tree and pass it down as props to child components. This is called &quot;lifting state up.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, props are for passing data from parent to child, while state is for managing data that can change within a component. Together, they enable you to build interactive and data-driven React applications. Hooks, especially the <code>useState</code> hook, make it easier to manage local state in functional components, further enhancing the capabilities of React functional components.</p>
<h2 id="hooks-in-functional-components"><a class="header" href="#hooks-in-functional-components">Hooks in Functional Components <a name="hooks"></a></a></h2>
<p>React introduced Hooks in version 16.8 as a way to add state and side-effects to functional components, which were previously limited to stateless rendering. </p>
<p>In React, &quot;stateless rendering&quot; refers to the practice of creating functional components (also known as stateless functional components) that are purely responsible for rendering UI based on the input data provided through props. These components do not manage or maintain any internal state.</p>
<p>Out with the old in with the new KING, hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic and side-effects across components, making functional components more powerful and flexible.</p>
<p>Some of the most commonly used hooks include:</p>
<h3 id="1-usestate"><a class="header" href="#1-usestate">1. <code>useState</code></a></h3>
<p>This one might sound familiar from above, <code>useState</code> hook allows functional components to manage local state. It takes an initial state value and returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="2-useeffect"><a class="header" href="#2-useeffect">2. <code>useEffect</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook enables you to perform side-effects in functional components. It takes a function that will be executed after every render, and you can specify dependencies to control when the effect should run.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    // Fetch data from an API and update the state
    fetchData().then((result) =&gt; setData(result));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array runs the effect only once
}

<p>React provides several other built-in hooks, such as <code>useContext</code> and <code>useReducer</code>, which allow you to manage context, state transitions, and references in functional components, respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>useContext</code>: Allows you to access the context API within functional components. It's useful for sharing data across the component tree without prop drilling.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return &lt;button className={theme}&gt;Themed Button&lt;/button&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>useReducer</code>: This hook is used for more complex state management and state transitions. It's similar to <code>setState</code> but offers more control over how state updates occur.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {state.count}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}&gt; Increment&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}&gt; Decrement&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="4-custom-hooks"><a class="header" href="#4-custom-hooks">4. Custom Hooks</a></h3>
<p>You can create your own custom hooks to encapsulate and share component logic across different components. Custom hooks promote code reuse and maintainability.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// Custom hook for handling form input state
import { useState } from 'react';

function useFormInput(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  const handleChange = (e) =&gt; {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  };

  return {
    value,
    onChange: handleChange,
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p>In summary, hooks in React are a way to manage state and side-effects in functional components. They integrate seamlessly with functional components, making it easier to write and maintain complex logic and enabling better code reuse. React's built-in hooks and the ability to create custom hooks provide a powerful toolset for building dynamic and interactive applications.</p>

<h2 id="calling-apis"><a class="header" href="#calling-apis">Calling APIs <a name="handling-api-requests"></a></a></h2>
<p>Calling APIs is a key part of any React App. It's what enables your app to communicate with the outside world - including, presumably, your backend.</p>
<p>Here's a helpful tutorial on the best practices for calling APIs in React:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFYF2GnMy8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYFYF2GnMy8</a></p>
<p>There's also a part 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tfd6ANaNRY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tfd6ANaNRY</a></p>
<p>The best ways to fetch data are using the popular package Axos (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios</a>) or the vanilla JS _fetch _function (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch</a>)</p>
<p>Once you have parsed the data, you'll probably want to store it in your state somehow (using useState or a redux store).</p>
<p>It is also good practice to encapsulate your entire API call into a custom hook, and name the hook according to what it does (ex. <em>useFetchPokemonStats</em>). This is also much easier to do if you use a state-management system like Redux, which is described below. </p>
<p>The methods described above let you call an API immediately upon rendering a certain component. But what happens if you want to manually trigger an API call (ex. after a certain action or event)?</p>
<p>Your API call should still use useEffect, and should look mostly like the calls you learned about in Part 1. The 1 difference is you need to guard the useEffect wisely in its dependency array.</p>
<p>As you recall, the dependency array of a useEffect contains everything that the useEffect depends upon - if any of its dependencies change, it will have a _side effect _of rerunning the useEffect.</p>
<p>So, you can define a specific variable which only changes when you want your API call to run. You can put that variable in the dependency array of the useEffect. When the action or event that you want to trigger the API call occurs, you should change the trigger variable. This change will trigger the useEffect to run. The trigger variable should never change except when you want the useEffect to run.</p>
<p>I personally like making my trigger variable an object which also contains any subvariables that my API call needs. So for example, if I was coding a call to a search API that included a text query and target price, my trigger object would contain those.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a very basic React application that calls an API to perform a search with a custom hook and a useEffect guarded by a trigger object as described above: <a href="https://github.com/Tech-Start-UCalgary/react-api-examples/tree/main/js-no-redux">https://github.com/Tech-Start-UCalgary/react-api-examples/tree/main/js-no-redux</a></p>
<h3 id="useswr"><a class="header" href="#useswr">useSWR</a></h3>
<p><img src="guides/React_Guide/images/image1.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>useSWR is a useful React hook for data fetching published by Vercel (creators of Next.js). </p>
<p>SWR stands for stale-while-revalidate. It allows for smart data fetching and encapsulates a lot of advanced fetching logic (like how often should you refetch? should you have a cache?) in a single line of code.</p>
<p>You should read more about useSWR here:</p>
<p><a href="https://swr.vercel.app/">https://swr.vercel.app/</a></p>

<h1 id="react-router"><a class="header" href="#react-router">React Router <a name="react-router"></a></a></h1>
<p><strong>React Router</strong> is a popular library used for routing in React applications. Routing is the process of determining which UI components should be displayed based on the current URL or path. React Router helps you create single-page applications with multiple views and navigate between them without requiring full page reloads.</p>
<p>Here's an elaboration on React Router and its integration with React:</p>
<h3 id="react-router-features"><a class="header" href="#react-router-features">React Router Features:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Declarative Routing:</strong> React Router uses a declarative approach, where you define the routes and their corresponding components in a clear and organized manner. You specify what component should be rendered when a particular URL is matched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nested Routing:</strong> React Router supports nested routes, allowing you to create complex and hierarchical UI structures. This is especially useful for building multi-level menus or complex application layouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route Parameters:</strong> You can define route parameters in your routes, allowing you to extract dynamic data from the URL. For example, a route like <code>/users/:id</code> can capture the <code>id</code> as a parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programmatic Navigation:</strong> React Router provides a set of functions for programmatic navigation. You can change the route, push to the browser's history, or replace the current route using these functions. This is useful for actions like form submissions or after successful authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route Guards:</strong> React Router allows you to implement route guards for protecting routes based on user authentication or other conditions. This ensures that users can only access certain routes if they meet specific criteria.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="integration-with-react"><a class="header" href="#integration-with-react">Integration with React:</a></h3>
<p>React Router is typically integrated into a React application as a separate library. Here's how it's commonly done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong> You start by installing React Router as a package in your React project. You can use either <code>react-router-dom</code> (for web applications) or <code>react-router-native</code> (for mobile applications).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install react-router-dom
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Router Component:</strong> You wrap your entire application (or a part of it) with a <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code> component provided by React Router. This component manages the application's navigation state and listens to changes in the URL.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      {/* Define your routes here */}
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route Configuration:</strong> Inside the <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code>, you define your routes using the <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component. Each <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component specifies a path and the component to render when the path matches.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Route path=&quot;/home&quot; component={Home} /&gt;
&lt;Route path=&quot;/about&quot; component={About} /&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route Navigation:</strong> To navigate between routes, you use the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component to create links or the <code>history</code> object to programmatically navigate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Link to=&quot;/home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;
// OR
history.push('/home');
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Route Parameters:</strong> You can use route parameters to capture dynamic values from the URL. These parameters are accessible as props in the routed components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Route path=&quot;/user/:id&quot; component={UserProfile} /&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nested Routes:</strong> You can nest routes by defining routes within the components rendered by other routes. This allows for hierarchical routing structures.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Route path=&quot;/dashboard&quot; component={Dashboard}&gt;
  &lt;Route path=&quot;/dashboard/profile&quot; component={Profile} /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By integrating React Router into your React application, you can create well-organized, client-side routing that provides a seamless and efficient user experience for navigating different parts of your application.</p>
<h1 id="react-with-redux"><a class="header" href="#react-with-redux">React with Redux <a name="redux"></a></a></h1>
<p>Redux is a widely used state container for javascript apps. As soon as your app reaches any level of data complexity, it makes a ton of sense to start using Redux to manage your state.</p>
<p><em>A fair warning: Redux <span style="text-decoration:underline;">will </span>seem complicated at the beginning. That's completely expected! Push through that initial discomfort and you'll get used to it in no time :)</em></p>
<p>Here is a great introductory video to React-Redux:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVpUuw9XSjY</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend using **createSlice <strong>to setup your Redux Store</strong>. **It is a simple way to encapsulate creating actions and slicers in a simple, easy-to-read, easy-to-understand way. Here is a short video that does a great job explaining how to use createSlice:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0MEtFaQTZk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0MEtFaQTZk</a></p>
<p>To access your Redux state and update your Redux state in React, I highly recommend using the twin hooks **useSelector **and <strong>useDispatch</strong> respectively. They are simple, easy, and elegant. </p>

<h1 id="lastly-nextjs"><a class="header" href="#lastly-nextjs">Lastly, Next.JS <a name="nextjs"></a></a></h1>
<p>Next.js is a framework built on top of React, designed to simplify and enhance the development of web applications. It provides several features and benefits while seamlessly integrating with React. Let's explore these aspects interactively:</p>
<p><strong>Q1: What is Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>Next.js is a framework for building web applications that are built on top of the React library. It simplifies many aspects of React development and adds capabilities for server-side rendering, routing, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: How does Next.js relate to React?</strong></p>
<p>Next.js is an extension of React. It leverages React's component-based structure and allows you to build React applications while providing additional tools and features for server-side rendering, routing, and other optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>Q3: What are some key features of Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>Next.js offers several key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</strong> Next.js enables server-side rendering, which improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing:</strong> It includes a built-in routing system, so you can easily define and navigate between pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File-Based Routing:</strong> Routes are created based on the file structure, making it intuitive and easy to organize your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic Code Splitting:</strong> It automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller, more manageable chunks, optimizing loading times.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4: How do you create a new Next.js app?</strong></p>
<p>To create a new Next.js app, you can use the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npx create-next-app my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm run dev
</code></pre>
<p>This will set up a new Next.js application and start the development server.</p>
<p><strong>Q5: Can you explain the pages and routing in Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>In Next.js, you create pages by simply adding files to the <code>pages</code> directory. Each file becomes a route. For example, if you create <code>pages/about.js</code>, you will have a route at <code>/about</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Q6: How does Next.js handle data fetching?</strong></p>
<p>Next.js allows you to fetch data during server-side rendering using the <code>getServerSideProps</code> function. This data can be injected into your React components as props.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from an API or database
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: { data },
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q7: What's the advantage of server-side rendering in Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>Server-side rendering in Next.js improves the initial loading speed of your application and helps with search engine optimization (SEO). It also ensures that users see content more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Q8: How can I build a static website with Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>Next.js provides static site generation (SSG) via the <code>getStaticProps</code> function. You can generate static HTML files for your pages at build time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Fetch data from an API or database
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: { data },
  };
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q9: Are there any limitations or trade-offs with Next.js?</strong></p>
<p>While Next.js offers many advantages, it may introduce complexity to smaller projects. It requires server-side rendering, which might not be necessary for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>Q10: Can I deploy Next.js applications to various hosting platforms?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can deploy Next.js applications to a wide range of hosting platforms, including Vercel, Netlify, and AWS. These platforms often provide built-in support for Next.js, making deployment straightforward.</p>
<p>Next.js is a powerful tool that enhances React applications by providing features like server-side rendering, routing, and automatic code splitting. It simplifies the development process and improves performance. If you have more specific questions or need further information about Next.js, feel free to ask!</p>

<h2 id="react-native-basics"><a class="header" href="#react-native-basics">React Native Basics: <a name="react-native-main-concepts"></a></a></h2>
<h3 id="components-in-react-native"><a class="header" href="#components-in-react-native">Components in React Native <a name="components"></a></a></h3>
<p>Components in React Native are similar to those in React, but with some variations and additional elements. Here's a more detailed breakdown:</p>
<h4 id="1-core-components"><a class="header" href="#1-core-components">1. Core Components:</a></h4>
<p>React Native provides a set of core components that are similar to HTML elements. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>View</code>: The fundamental component for creating UI layouts.</li>
<li><code>Text</code>: Used for displaying text.</li>
<li><code>Image</code>: For displaying images.</li>
<li><code>ScrollView</code>: For scrollable content.</li>
<li><code>TextInput</code>: For text input fields.</li>
<li>And many more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-custom-components"><a class="header" href="#2-custom-components">2. Custom Components:</a></h4>
<p>You can create your custom components just like in React. These components can be stateless functional components or class components. To create a custom component, use the <code>View</code>, <code>Text</code>, <code>Image</code>, and other core components to compose your UI.</p>
<h2 id="styling-in-react-native"><a class="header" href="#styling-in-react-native">Styling in React Native <a name="styling"></a></a></h2>
<p>Styling in React Native is different from traditional web development. You have various options for styling your components:</p>
<h4 id="a-inline-styles"><a class="header" href="#a-inline-styles">a. Inline Styles:</a></h4>
<p>React Native supports inline styles using JavaScript objects. You can apply styles directly to components, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'lightblue' }}&gt;
  &lt;Text style={{ fontSize: 20, color: 'black' }}&gt;Hello, React Native!&lt;/Text&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="b-stylesheets"><a class="header" href="#b-stylesheets">b. Stylesheets:</a></h4>
<p>Using stylesheets, you can create reusable style definitions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 20,
    color: 'black',
  },
});

&lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;
  &lt;Text style={styles.text}&gt;Hello, React Native!&lt;/Text&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="c-flexbox-layout"><a class="header" href="#c-flexbox-layout">c. Flexbox Layout:</a></h4>
<p>React Native relies heavily on flexbox for layout design. It's similar to CSS flexbox but with a few differences. You can use properties like <code>flex</code>, <code>alignItems</code>, and <code>justifyContent</code> to control layout.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;View style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'column', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}&gt;
  &lt;Text&gt;Hello, React Native!&lt;/Text&gt;
&lt;/View&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="layout-in-react-native"><a class="header" href="#layout-in-react-native">Layout in React Native <a name="layout"></a></a></h2>
<p>Understanding layout is vital in React Native to create responsive and visually appealing designs.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flexbox Layout: Flexbox is the primary layout system in React Native. It allows you to design flexible and adaptive layouts. Key properties include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>flex</code>: Determines how space is distributed among children.</li>
<li><code>alignItems</code>: Aligns items along the cross-axis (vertical alignment).</li>
<li><code>justifyContent</code>: Aligns items along the main axis (horizontal alignment).</li>
<li><code>flexDirection</code>: Sets the direction of the main axis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong> You can control the position of elements using properties like <code>position</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>bottom</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Set dimensions using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. You can use percentages, fixed values, or dynamic values like <code>flex</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> React Native allows you to create responsive designs using <code>Dimensions</code> and the <code>onLayout</code> event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orientation Handling:</strong> Handle changes in device orientation by adjusting your layout accordingly. Use the <code>Dimensions</code> API to detect changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stylesheet Composition:</strong> Compose styles using stylesheets and conditionally apply styles based on screen dimensions or other criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Separation of Concerns: Keep styles, logic, and presentation separate for better maintainability and code clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimizing Styles: Optimize styles to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve app performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By mastering these concepts related to components, styling, and layout in React Native, you can create rich and visually appealing mobile app user interfaces. Flexbox, in particular, is a powerful tool for creating flexible layouts, and understanding the nuances of styling is crucial for developing a professional-looking app.</p>
<h2 id="navigation"><a class="header" href="#navigation">Navigation: <a name="navigation"></a></a></h2>
<p>Navigation is a crucial aspect of building mobile applications with React Native. It involves creating the structure and flow of your app, allowing users to move between different screens or views. The most common library for implementing navigation in React Native is <strong>React Navigation</strong>. Here's a more detailed overview of navigation in React Native:</p>
<p><strong>1. Installing React Navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To get started with React Navigation, you need to install it in your project using npm or yarn:
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stack Navigator:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Stack Navigator is one of the most commonly used navigators in React Navigation. It allows you to create a stack of screens where each screen is placed on top of the previous one. You can navigate between screens by pushing and popping them from the stack.</li>
<li>To set up a Stack Navigator, you need to import it and define your screens.
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Defining Screens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each screen in your app is defined as a React component. For example, you might have a HomeScreen and a ProfileScreen.
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function HomeScreen() {
  // Your screen's content
}

function ProfileScreen() {
  // Your screen's content
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Navigating Between Screens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can navigate between screens using navigation functions provided by React Navigation. For example, to navigate from the HomeScreen to the ProfileScreen:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
    return (
        &lt;NavigationContainer&gt;
        &lt;Stack.Navigator&gt;
            &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Home&quot; component={HomeScreen} /&gt;
            &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;Profile&quot; component={ProfileScreen} /&gt;
        &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
        &lt;/NavigationContainer&gt;
    );
}
</code></pre>
In your HomeScreen component, you can use <code>navigation.navigate('Profile')</code> to navigate to the ProfileScreen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Passing Data Between Screens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can pass data from one screen to another using parameters. For example, you can send a user's ID to the ProfileScreen:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// In HomeScreen
navigation.navigate('Profile', { userId: 123 });

// In ProfileScreen
const userId = route.params.userId;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. Drawer Navigation and Tab Navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>React Navigation also supports Drawer and Tab navigations. The Drawer Navigator creates a sidebar menu for navigation, while the Tab Navigator allows you to switch between different tabs within an app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. Nested Navigation:</strong></p>
<p>React Navigation allows you to nest navigators within each other, creating complex navigation structures. This can be useful when you have a tab navigator and want to use a stack navigator within one of the tabs, or if you want to combine different types of navigators for more intricate navigation patterns.</p>
<p>Here's an example of nesting a Stack Navigator within a Tab Navigator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator();
const Stack = createStackNavigator();

// Define a tab navigator with a stack navigator in one of the tabs
function TabNavigator() {
  return (
    &lt;Tab.Navigator&gt;
      &lt;Tab.Screen name=&quot;Tab1&quot; component={Tab1Component} /&gt;
      &lt;Tab.Screen name=&quot;Tab2&quot; component={Tab2Component} /&gt;
      &lt;Tab.Screen name=&quot;Tab3&quot; component={StackScreen} /&gt;
    &lt;/Tab.Navigator&gt;
  );
}

// Define a stack navigator to use within a tab
function StackScreen() {
  return (
    &lt;Stack.Navigator&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;StackScreen1&quot; component={StackScreen1Component} /&gt;
      &lt;Stack.Screen name=&quot;StackScreen2&quot; component={StackScreen2Component} /&gt;
    &lt;/Stack.Navigator&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>8. Navigation Lifecycle:</strong></p>
<p>React Navigation provides navigation lifecycle events that allow you to perform actions when a screen comes into view or goes out of view. Common lifecycle events include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>focus</code>: Triggered when a screen comes into focus.</li>
<li><code>blur</code>: Triggered when a screen loses focus.</li>
<li><code>didFocus</code>: Triggered after the screen has come into focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add listeners to these events to perform actions or fetch data when a screen is in focus.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { useFocusEffect } from '@react-navigation/native';

function MyScreen({ navigation }) {
  // Add a focus event listener
  useFocusEffect(
    React.useCallback(() =&gt; {
      // Perform actions when the screen comes into focus
      console.log('Screen is in focus');
      // You can also fetch data or make API calls here
    }, [])
  );

  // ... rest of the screen component
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>9. Screen Options:</strong></p>
<p>You can customize the appearance and behavior of each screen's navigation using the <code>options</code> property in your screen component. This allows you to set options like the screen title, header style, and more.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyScreen({ route, navigation }) {
  // Define screen-specific options
  React.useLayoutEffect(() =&gt; {
    navigation.setOptions({
      title: 'Custom Title',
      headerStyle: {
        backgroundColor: 'blue',
      },
      headerTintColor: 'white',
    });
  }, [navigation]);

  // ... rest of the screen component
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>10. Navigation Methods:</strong></p>
<p>React Navigation provides a set of methods that allow you to navigate between screens programmatically. Common methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>navigate</code>: Navigate to a new screen in the same stack.</li>
<li><code>push</code>: Push a new screen onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>pop</code>: Pop the current screen from the stack.</li>
<li><code>goBack</code>: Navigate back to the previous screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods are accessible through the <code>navigation</code> prop in your screen components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function MyScreen({ navigation }) {
  return (
    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Go to Screen2&quot; onPress={() =&gt; navigation.navigate('Screen2')} /&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Push Screen3&quot; onPress={() =&gt; navigation.push('Screen3')} /&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Go Back&quot; onPress={() =&gt; navigation.goBack()} /&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>These features offer extensive flexibility in designing complex navigation structures and allow you to respond to navigation events and customize screen-specific options. Understanding these concepts is crucial for building intuitive and feature-rich navigation in your React Native applications.</p>
<h2 id="platform-specific-code"><a class="header" href="#platform-specific-code">Platform-Specific Code: <a name="platform-specific"></a></a></h2>
<p>Platform-specific code in React Native involves writing code that is specific to either iOS or Android platforms. This is sometimes necessary when you want to implement platform-specific features, handle platform-specific behaviors, or optimize your app for a particular platform. Here's a more detailed overview of this topic:</p>
<p><strong>1. Platform-Specific Components and Styling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>React Native allows you to conditionally render components or apply styles based on the platform. For example, you can use the <code>Platform.OS</code> property to determine the platform:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () =&gt; (
  &lt;View&gt;
    &lt;Text&gt;Common Text&lt;/Text&gt;
    {Platform.OS === 'ios' &amp;&amp; &lt;Text&gt;iOS only Text&lt;/Text&gt;}
    {Platform.OS === 'android' &amp;&amp; &lt;Text&gt;Android only Text&lt;/Text&gt;}
  &lt;/View&gt;
);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, you can conditionally apply styles:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  commonStyle: {
    // Common styles
  },
  iosStyle: {
    // iOS-specific styles
  },
  androidStyle: {
    // Android-specific styles
  },
});

const MyComponent = () =&gt; (
  &lt;View&gt;
    &lt;Text style={[styles.commonStyle, Platform.OS === 'ios' ? styles.iosStyle : styles.androidStyle]}&gt;
      Platform-specific styling
    &lt;/Text&gt;
  &lt;/View&gt;
);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Platform-Specific Modules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In some cases, you might need to use platform-specific modules or APIs. React Native provides a way to do this using the <code>.ios.js</code> and <code>.android.js</code> file extensions. For example, you can have separate implementations for iOS and Android as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MyModule.ios.js</code> for iOS-specific code.</li>
<li><code>MyModule.android.js</code> for Android-specific code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>React Native will automatically pick the right file based on the platform. This is useful when dealing with platform-specific features or APIs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Conditional Logic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use conditional logic to handle platform-specific behaviors. For instance, you might need to request permissions differently on iOS and Android or use platform-specific libraries.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { PermissionsAndroid, Platform } from 'react-native';

async function requestLocationPermission() {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    // Android-specific logic for requesting permissions
    try {
      const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION,
      );
      if (granted === PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED) {
        console.log('Location permission granted.');
      } else {
        console.log('Location permission denied.');
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(err);
    }
  } else if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    // iOS-specific logic for requesting permissions
    // ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Platform-Specific Libraries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are times when you need to use platform-specific libraries or modules. React Native allows you to conditionally include these libraries based on the platform. You can use conditional <code>require</code> statements to achieve this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let platformSpecificLibrary;
if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
  platformSpecificLibrary = require('ios-specific-library');
} else {
  platformSpecificLibrary = require('android-specific-library');
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Native Modules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For highly platform-specific tasks, you might need to write native code (Objective-C/Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android) and create native modules. These native modules can be called from your React Native code, allowing you to perform platform-specific tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding how to handle platform-specific code is important for ensuring your React Native app functions correctly and efficiently on both iOS and Android devices. By using these techniques, you can create a seamless and native-like experience for users on each platform.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-device-features"><a class="header" href="#accessing-device-features">Accessing Device Features: <a name="device-features"></a></a></h2>
<p>Accessing device features in React Native involves interacting with native device functionality, such as the camera, geolocation, sensors, and more. Here, I'll provide more detail on this topic and examples of how to access specific device features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To access the camera in React Native, you can use the <code>react-native-camera</code> library. This library allows you to capture photos and record videos. You can also customize the camera settings, switch between front and back cameras, and apply real-time image processing.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera';

// In your component
&lt;RNCamera
  type={RNCamera.Constants.Type.back}
  flashMode={RNCamera.Constants.FlashMode.auto}
/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geolocation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To access the device's location, you can use the built-in <code>Geolocation</code> module in React Native. It provides methods for retrieving the user's current location and monitoring changes in real-time.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import Geolocation from '@react-native-community/geolocation';

// Get the current location
Geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) =&gt; {
  console.log(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
});
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>React Native provides access to various device sensors, including the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, through the <code>react-native-sensors</code> library. You can use this library to collect data from these sensors.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { Accelerometer } from 'react-native-sensors';

const accelerometerObservable = new Accelerometer();

const subscription = accelerometerObservable.subscribe((data) =&gt; {
  console.log('Acceleration X:', data.x);
  console.log('Acceleration Y:', data.y);
  console.log('Acceleration Z:', data.z);
});
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contacts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing device contacts can be achieved using the <code>react-native-contacts</code> library. This allows you to read and write contacts to the user's address book.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import Contacts from 'react-native-contacts';

// Fetch all contacts
Contacts.getAll()
  .then((contacts) =&gt; {
    console.log(contacts);
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error(error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Device Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>React Native provides device information through the <code>react-native-device-info</code> library. You can retrieve details like the device's manufacturer, model, unique identifier, and more.</li>
<li>Example:
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import DeviceInfo from 'react-native-device-info';

// Get device information
console.log('Device Model:', DeviceInfo.getModel());
console.log('Device ID:', DeviceInfo.getUniqueId());
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bluetooth and NFC:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To work with Bluetooth and NFC, you can use libraries like <code>react-native-ble-manager</code> and <code>react-native-nfc-manager</code>. These libraries enable communication with nearby devices and NFC tags.</li>
<li>Examples can get quite involved, as working with Bluetooth and NFC often requires handling various events and connections. You can refer to the library <a href="https://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager">documentation</a> for detailed examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When accessing device features in React Native, it's essential to follow the documentation and best practices for the specific libraries and modules you're using. Additionally, consider handling permissions appropriately, especially for features like camera, geolocation, and contacts, which may require user consent.</p>
<h2 id="native-modules-and-bridges"><a class="header" href="#native-modules-and-bridges">Native Modules and Bridges: <a name="modules-bridges"></a></a></h2>
<p>Native modules and bridges in React Native are a way to access native code (Java or Objective-C) from JavaScript and vice versa. They are essential for tasks that require platform-specific functionality or performance optimization. Let's dive into more detail and provide examples of how to create and use native modules and bridges in React Native.</p>
<h3 id="native-modules"><a class="header" href="#native-modules">Native Modules</a></h3>
<p>Native modules allow you to expose native code to JavaScript in a structured manner. Here's how to create a simple native module:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a Native Module for iOS (Objective-C):</strong></p>
<p>Let's say you want to create a native module that shows a native iOS alert.</p>
<pre><code class="language-objective-c">// AlertModule.h
#import &lt;React/RCTBridgeModule.h&gt;

@interface AlertModule : NSObject &lt;RCTBridgeModule&gt;
@end
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-objective-c">// AlertModule.m
#import &quot;AlertModule.h&quot;
#import &lt;React/RCTLog.h&gt;

@implementation AlertModule

RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(showAlert:(NSString *)title message:(NSString *)message)
{
    UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController
        alertControllerWithTitle:title
        message:message
        preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];

    UIAlertAction *ok = [UIAlertAction
        actionWithTitle:@&quot;OK&quot;
        style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault
        handler:nil];

    [alert addAction:ok];
    
    UIViewController *rootViewController = [[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] window] rootViewController];
    [rootViewController presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
}

@end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a Native Module for Android (Java):</strong></p>
<p>To do the same thing in Android, create a native module to show an alert dialog.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// AlertModule.java
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactApplicationContext;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactContextBaseJavaModule;
import com.facebook.react.bridge.ReactMethod;

public class AlertModule extends ReactContextBaseJavaModule {
    public AlertModule(ReactApplicationContext reactContext) {
        super(reactContext);
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return &quot;AlertModule&quot;;
    }

    @ReactMethod
    public void showAlert(String title, String message) {
        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(getCurrentActivity());
        builder.setTitle(title);
        builder.setMessage(message);
        builder.setPositiveButton(&quot;OK&quot;, null);
        builder.show();
    }
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using Native Modules in JavaScript:</strong></p>
<p>In your JavaScript code, you can now use the native module you created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

// For iOS
NativeModules.AlertModule.showAlert('Hello', 'This is an alert!');

// For Android
NativeModules.AlertModule.showAlert('Hello', 'This is an alert!');
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="native-bridges"><a class="header" href="#native-bridges">Native Bridges</a></h3>
<p>Bridges in React Native are responsible for connecting JavaScript and native code. React Native's native modules use bridges to enable communication between the two sides. In the examples above, the React Native framework handles the bridge for you. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes, React Native's bridge system serializes and deserializes data and manages the communication between JavaScript and native modules. It abstracts away many of the complexities, making it easier for developers to work with native modules in a JavaScript-friendly way.</p>
<p>By using native modules and bridges, you can incorporate platform-specific functionality into your React Native app while maintaining a unified JavaScript codebase. This is particularly helpful when you need to integrate with device-specific features, third-party libraries, or optimize performance.</p>
<p>Here are some tutorials that dive super in depth for creating a calender native module for <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android">Android</a> or <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios">IOS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="state-management"><a class="header" href="#state-management">State Management: <a name="state-managment"></a></a></h2>
<p>let's dive into more detail on state management in React Native and provide examples. State management is crucial for handling the data and UI state in your mobile applications. There are various options for managing state in React Native, similar to React for the web, including React's built-in state management, the Context API, and external libraries like Redux or MobX. Below, we'll cover these options and provide examples for better understanding:</p>
<h3 id="1-reacts-built-in-state-management"><a class="header" href="#1-reacts-built-in-state-management">1. <strong>React's Built-in State Management:</strong></a></h3>
<p>React Native, like React, allows you to manage state locally within a component using the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () =&gt; setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () =&gt; setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;Text&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Increment&quot; onPress={increment} /&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Decrement&quot; onPress={decrement} /&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>useState</code> hook is used to manage the <code>count</code> state variable within the <code>Counter</code> component.</p>
<h3 id="2-context-api"><a class="header" href="#2-context-api">2. <strong>Context API:</strong></a></h3>
<p>The Context API allows you to manage global state that can be accessed by multiple components without having to pass props down through the component tree.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const CountContext = createContext();

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useContext(CountContext);

  const increment = () =&gt; setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () =&gt; setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;Text&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Increment&quot; onPress={increment} /&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Decrement&quot; onPress={decrement} /&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;CountContext.Provider value={[count, setCount]}&gt;
      &lt;View&gt;
        &lt;Text&gt;My App&lt;/Text&gt;
        &lt;Counter /&gt;
      &lt;/View&gt;
    &lt;/CountContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>CountContext</code> is created and used to share the <code>count</code> state between the <code>Counter</code> component and the <code>App</code> component.</p>
<h3 id="3-redux"><a class="header" href="#3-redux">3. <strong>Redux:</strong></a></h3>
<p>Redux is a popular external state management library for React Native. It provides a central store for managing application state and allows for predictable state updates using actions and reducers.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>To use Redux in React Native, you need to set up a store, actions, and reducers. Here's a simplified example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Define actions
const increment = () =&gt; ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
const decrement = () =&gt; ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });

// Define a reducer
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Create the Redux store
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Connect components to the store
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

function Counter({ count, increment, decrement }) {
  return (
    &lt;View&gt;
      &lt;Text&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/Text&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Increment&quot; onPress={increment} /&gt;
      &lt;Button title=&quot;Decrement&quot; onPress={decrement} /&gt;
    &lt;/View&gt;
  );
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; ({ count: state });
const mapDispatchToProps = { increment, decrement };

const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
</code></pre>
<p>This example demonstrates a basic setup of Redux in React Native. It involves defining actions, a reducer, creating the store, and connecting a component to the store.</p>
<p>The choice of state management in your React Native project depends on the complexity and scalability of your application. React's built-in state management and the Context API are great for simple state needs, while Redux or MobX are more suitable for larger, complex applications with extensive state management requirements.</p>
<h2 id="async-storage"><a class="header" href="#async-storage">Async Storage: <a name="async-storage"></a></a></h2>
<p>AsyncStorage is a crucial concept in React Native, allowing you to store data locally on the user's device. It's similar to the <code>localStorage</code> in web development but tailored for mobile applications. AsyncStorage is often used to store user preferences, app settings, or any data that needs to persist across app sessions. Here, I'll dive into more detail about AsyncStorage and provide some examples.</p>
<h3 id="using-asyncstorage-in-react-native"><a class="header" href="#using-asyncstorage-in-react-native">Using AsyncStorage in React Native</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Importing AsyncStorage:</strong>
To use AsyncStorage, you need to import it from 'react-native':</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native';
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storing Data:</strong>
You can store data in AsyncStorage by using the <code>setItem</code> method. Here's an example of how to store a simple string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">AsyncStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe')
  .then(() =&gt; {
    console.log('Data stored successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error storing data: ', error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Retrieving Data:</strong>
To retrieve data, you can use the <code>getItem</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">AsyncStorage.getItem('username')
  .then((value) =&gt; {
    if (value !== null) {
      console.log('Retrieved data: ', value);
    } else {
      console.log('Data not found');
    }
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error retrieving data: ', error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updating Data:</strong>
You can update stored data by simply setting a new value for the same key:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">AsyncStorage.setItem('username', 'NewUsername')
  .then(() =&gt; {
    console.log('Data updated successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error updating data: ', error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deleting Data:</strong>
To remove data from AsyncStorage, use the <code>removeItem</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">AsyncStorage.removeItem('username')
  .then(() =&gt; {
    console.log('Data removed successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error removing data: ', error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling Errors:</strong>
It's essential to handle errors, as reading from or writing to AsyncStorage may fail due to various reasons, such as storage limitations or permissions. Always use <code>try...catch</code> or promise-based error handling to ensure your app gracefully handles errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working with JSON Data:</strong>
AsyncStorage stores data as strings, so if you need to store complex data structures like objects or arrays, you should serialize them to JSON when storing and parse them when retrieving:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const user = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com',
};

AsyncStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user))
  .then(() =&gt; {
    console.log('User data stored successfully');
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error storing user data: ', error);
  });

// Retrieving and parsing the user data
AsyncStorage.getItem('user')
  .then((value) =&gt; {
    if (value !== null) {
      const userData = JSON.parse(value);
      console.log('Retrieved user data: ', userData);
    } else {
      console.log('User data not found');
    }
  })
  .catch((error) =&gt; {
    console.error('Error retrieving user data: ', error);
  });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that AsyncStorage is a simple key-value store and should be used for relatively small amounts of data. For larger datasets, consider using a more robust storage solution or a database. Additionally, be mindful of security considerations when storing sensitive information and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access AsyncStorage on the user's device.</p>
<h2 id="network-requests"><a class="header" href="#network-requests">Network Requests: <a name="network-requests"></a></a></h2>
<p>Making network requests in React Native is a common task when you need to fetch data from an API or send data to a server. You can use libraries like Axios or the built-in <code>fetch</code> API to perform these requests. Here, I'll dive into more detail about how to make network requests in React Native using both Axios and <code>fetch</code>, and provide examples for each:</p>
<h3 id="using-axios"><a class="header" href="#using-axios">Using Axios</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> is a popular library for making HTTP requests. You can use it in your React Native project by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation</strong>:</p>
<p>First, you need to install Axios in your project. You can do this with npm or yarn:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install axios
# or
yarn add axios
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making a GET Request</strong>:</p>
<p>Here's an example of making a GET request to a remote API using Axios:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import axios from 'axios';

const fetchUserData = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/users');
    const userData = response.data;
    console.log(userData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
  }
};

// Call the function to fetch user data
fetchUserData();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making a POST Request</strong>:</p>
<p>To make a POST request with Axios, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import axios from 'axios';

const sendDataToServer = async (data) =&gt; {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('https://api.example.com/postData', data);
    console.log('Data sent successfully:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending data:', error);
  }
};

const dataToSend = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2',
};

// Call the function to send data to the server
sendDataToServer(dataToSend);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="using-the-fetch-api"><a class="header" href="#using-the-fetch-api">Using the <code>fetch</code> API</a></h3>
<p>The <code>fetch</code> API is a built-in way to make network requests in JavaScript and is available in React Native:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Making a GET Request</strong>:</p>
<p>Here's an example of making a GET request using the <code>fetch</code> API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const fetchUserData = () =&gt; {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
    .then((response) =&gt; {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
      }
      return response.json();
    })
    .then((userData) =&gt; {
      console.log(userData);
    })
    .catch((error) =&gt; {
      console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
    });
};

// Call the function to fetch user data
fetchUserData();
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Making a POST Request</strong>:</p>
<p>Making a POST request with <code>fetch</code> involves a similar structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const sendDataToServer = (data) =&gt; {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/postData', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
      }
      return response.json();
    })
    .then((responseData) =&gt; {
      console.log('Data sent successfully:', responseData);
    })
    .catch((error) =&gt; {
      console.error('Error sending data:', error);
    });
};

const dataToSend = {
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2',
};

// Call the function to send data to the server
sendDataToServer(dataToSend);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both Axios and the <code>fetch</code> API allow you to make various types of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handle responses. The choice between the two often comes down to personal preference and specific project requirements. Axios is a popular choice due to its simplicity and ease of use for handling requests and responses.</p>

<h2 id="security-best-practices"><a class="header" href="#security-best-practices">Security Best Practices: <a name="security"></a></a></h2>
<p>Security is a critical aspect of any mobile app, including those built with React Native. Here are some security best practices in React Native, along with examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Storage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use secure storage mechanisms to store sensitive data, such as user authentication tokens and API keys. Avoid storing them in plain text or insecure locations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Insecure storage
const apiKey = 'my-insecure-api-key';

// Secure storage using a library like react-native-secure-storage
import SecureStorage from 'react-native-secure-storage';

SecureStorage.set('api_key', 'my-secure-api-key');
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API Key Management:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid hardcoding API keys directly in your source code. Instead, use environment variables or configuration files that are excluded from source control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Insecure API key storage
const apiKey = 'my-insecure-api-key';

// Secure API key storage using environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.REACT_NATIVE_API_KEY;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and control access to sensitive parts of your app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Use a secure authentication library like Firebase Authentication or Auth0
import { Firebase } from 'react-native-firebase';

// Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain features
if (user.isAuthenticated) {
  // Display sensitive data or allow certain actions
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use HTTPS for all network requests to encrypt data in transit. Avoid sending sensitive information via unencrypted HTTP.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Use HTTPS for network requests
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + user.token,
  },
})
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Obfuscation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obfuscate your JavaScript code to make it more difficult for malicious actors to reverse engineer your app. Obfuscation is typically done using third-party tools, and the specific steps and tools used may vary depending on the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Communication with Native Modules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When communicating with native modules, validate and sanitize data to prevent injection attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

// Ensure the data passed to a native module is properly sanitized
const userInput = 'user-input-data';
NativeModules.MyModule.someMethod(validateInput(userInput));
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Validation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Validate user input to prevent common security issues like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Validate and sanitize user input to prevent XSS
const userInput = '&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS attack&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;';
const sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(userInput);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Error Handling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement proper error handling to prevent sensitive information from being exposed to users in error messages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Handle errors gracefully and do not expose sensitive information to the user
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred. Please try again later.');
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are essential security best practices for React Native apps, but it's important to note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on your project and the libraries you use. Regularly staying informed about security developments in the React Native ecosystem and taking proactive measures to address vulnerabilities will help ensure the security of your app.</p>

<h1 id="part-1---html"><a class="header" href="#part-1---html">Part 1 - HTML</a></h1>
<p>HTML is the building block of all webpages. It's ubiquitous throughout application design - everything from websites to mobile apps to desktop apps use HTML as the base for their frontend. </p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image8.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Luckily for you, HTML is also very simple. Don't spend too much time learning it as a beginner - while more advanced HTML concepts do exist, all you need to get started is a basic understanding of how it works.</p>
<p>To get started, I recommend watching this video and experimenting by building your own HTML document alongside it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE</a></p>
<p>To generate a favicon for your site, use this site: <a href="https://realfavicongenerator.net/">https://realfavicongenerator.net/</a></p>
<p>No matter which text editor you use (Atom, VSCode, Sublime Text, or something else), I recommend searching for editor plugins to improve your experience writing HTML. Google is your friend here.</p>
<h1 id="part-2---css"><a class="header" href="#part-2---css">Part 2 - CSS</a></h1>
<p>If HTML is the backbone of frontends, CSS is the paint. It's an extremely versatile and powerful way of styling and beautifying your content. CSS is easy to get into, but very difficult to master- if front-end development interests you, I recommend dedicating a significant amount of time towards learning CSS.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image6.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>To get started, check out this 1 hour introductory video to CSS:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI</a></p>
<p>Another alternative is this free course on Scrimba, which also covers HTML: <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlcss">https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlcss</a></p>
<p>One topic that isn't covered in much detail in the previous video is CSS selectors. For most purposes, you'll probably want to keep your selectors simple (using only class names the vast majority of the time). If you want to learn more about advanced selectors, check out this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcr70LIJcOk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcr70LIJcOk</a></p>
<p>When working on projects with other people, I recommend avoiding element-level selectors, as they can easily screw with work that others are doing. </p>
<p>Once you have a good grasp of the basics of CSS, one area that I highly recommend learning is <strong>CSS Grid.</strong> CSS Grid is a fantastic way of organizing and positioning html content, and it comes with loads of features that make it easy to build adaptive web pages. By combining CSS Grid with CSS breakpoints, you can design interfaces that look great on any size of screen, whether it's a big desktop computer or a small mobile phone. </p>
<p>Highly recommended course for CSS Grid:  <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/cssgrid">https://scrimba.com/learn/cssgrid</a></p>
<p>(Warning: CSS grid is not supported by some outdated browsers and browsers like Opera Mini which are used mostly in third world countries to save data. If your intended audience includes these people, do not use CSS Grid.)</p>
<p>How should you organize and refactor your CSS? I recommend using the BEM strategy for your CSS selectors. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/</a></p>
<p>BEM is a particularly helpful methodology to adopt when you're building websites from components like in React, since you can keep the CSS for each component in a separate file. However, it's far from the only strategy for CSS organization, so you can research and adopt others if they suit your needs better.</p>
<p>Knowing CSS Flexbox is also helpful for arranging the layouts of websites. It's like </p>
<p>Finally, here is a great video to watch for some simple, powerful tips for writing modern CSS:</p>

<h1 id="part-3---javascript"><a class="header" href="#part-3---javascript">Part 3 - Javascript</a></h1>
<p>JavaScript drives the interactivity and functionality of websites. Using it, you can respond to the user's interactions on your website and you can modify the properties of your HTML dynamically. </p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image4.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>To get started with JavaScript, you can watch this playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDyQo7g0_nsX8_gZAB8KD1lL4j4halQBJ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDyQo7g0_nsX8_gZAB8KD1lL4j4halQBJ</a></p>
<p>If you're brand new to programming, you should spend more time learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. </p>
<p>There are a few areas of JavaScript which may be confusing to any newcomers to the language, even if you have previously learned other languages. I recommend practicing and studying to get used to these features.</p>

<p>If you encounter another area of JavaScript that gives you troubles let me know and I'll add a section to this guide.</p>
<h2 id="31-nodejs"><a class="header" href="#31-nodejs">3.1 Node.js</a></h2>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image5.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Here's an introduction to Node.js: JavaScript, but for your operating system instead of your browser. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrzD9HAZK4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrzD9HAZK4</a> Node.js is frequently used as the backend for the server side of an application or web app. </p>
<p><strong>Installing Node.js</strong></p>
<p>We recommend using NVM (node version manager) to install node.js. It allows you to install, uninstall, and switch between different versions of node.js very quickly. Often, you'll need to switch between different versions of node for different projects, so you'll save time by using nvm from the start.</p>
<p>NVM (Mac/Linux): <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm</a></p>
<p>NVM for windows: <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows</a> </p>
<p>Once installed, you can type &quot;nvm&quot; in your CLI to see a red list of commands you can use. Follow instructions on GitHub for proper usage!</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong></p>
<p>One of the most common Node.js frameworks is Express. Express is an unopinionated_ (meaning, it doesn't force you to do things any particular way) _framework that excels at allowing you to write APIs. We may include more content on Express here in the future.</p>

<h2 id="-2"><a class="header" href="#-2"></a></h2>
<h2 id="32-typescript"><a class="header" href="#32-typescript">3.2** TypeScript**</a></h2>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of Javascript that introduces new features mostly related to strong typing: this lets you safeguard your variables and functions and helps you catch the most frequent mistakes and bugs from JavaScript code. </p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image7.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>TypeScript is contained in .ts files, and using a compiler you can compile it into vanilla JavaScript .js files which run as expected on a computer. If you anticipate doing a lot of work with JavaScript, I highly recommend learning TypeScript - although it isn't necessary for every project, it immensely improves the quality of the coding experience and it can guide you towards mastering tricky concepts from JavaScript like promises and callbacks.</p>

<p>NOTE: here is a more indepth <a href="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/../React_Guide/README.html">React Guide</a>, the better version!!</p>
<p>HTML, CSS, and JS are great and all, but what if you want to make a modern, reactive website? Several frontend frameworks exist to empower dynamic, reactive sites, and as of 2021 React is by far the most popular among them. It's a great way to get an introduction into the world of web frameworks and it's a fun tool to use. </p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image2.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>Here's a good free overview of the basics of React: <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact">https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact</a></p>
<p>Plenty of similar courses are available on YouTube and other course platforms. </p>
<p>When in doubt, consult the React documentation: <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/">https://reactjs.org/docs/</a></p>
<p>Note that much of the documentation still uses class-based components, as opposed to function-based components. Nowadays, it is 99% preferable to use function-based components whenever possible. It cuts down on the amount of boilerplate you need to write and enables helpful features from hooks.</p>
<p>Learn more about React Hooks: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNhaISOUy6Q&amp;t=396s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNhaISOUy6Q</a></p>
<p>The 2 hooks in particular you should be very familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>**useState - **for basic state/data management</li>
<li><strong>useEffect</strong> - ubiquitous in React. It is used for creating consequences (&quot;effects&quot;) for changes in data. It's a critical part of designing React applications to have a functional (not object-oriented) architecture, and you should be using it to create custom hooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other hooks that are handy to know about are useRef, useCallback, and useLayoutEffect.</p>
<p>To learn React, you should know HTML, CSS, and JS before. You can also build React apps with TypeScript instead of JavaScript. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html">https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html</a></p>
<p><strong>React Context API</strong></p>
<p>The context API is a tool you can use in React to share state from an upper level component (a provider) to its children. If you have state that needs to be shared across many children, you can use the context API rather than pass everything down manually as props.</p>
<p>To learn about the context API, I recommend watching this video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35lXWvCuM8o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35lXWvCuM8o</a></p>
<p>**React Router **</p>
<p>If you want to make React websites with multiple pages, you can use React Router.  It is a package that enables your app to have multiple routes. This series gives a quick overview of React Router:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZGzwEjZrXc&amp;list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&amp;index=21">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZGzwEjZrXc&amp;list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d&amp;index=21</a></p>
<p>React Router is lightweight and best suited for very small projects. If you plan on building a larger website with React, we recommend using Next.js instead - it has a lot more features including pre-rendering pages on the server for SEO optimization. Next.js is also widely used and has industry-level support.</p>
<p><img src="guides/Web_Dev_Guide/images/image3.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<p>React Redux is a commonly used package for managing global state. It allows you to take care of state in a global store that can be accessed or modified from anywhere in your application. </p>

<p><strong>Using React with Typescript</strong></p>
<p>Here is a great cheatsheet that you should read to get started with using React in combination with Typescript:</p>

<h2 id="design-process"><a class="header" href="#design-process">Design Process <a name="designprocess"></a></a></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> a design process helps you break down a project into manageable chunks and gives your work structure.</p>
<p>Terms like “design thinking” and “human-centered design” all boil down to the idea of understanding the needs and behaviors of users, and translating that understanding into a well-designed interface. So, <strong>keep the user front and center in your design approach!</strong></p>
<p>There’s various design processes out there but we recommend using the double diamond design process.</p>
<p><strong>The double diamond design process has 4 stages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Discover</li>
<li>Define</li>
<li>Develop</li>
<li>Deliver</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this design process is not linear— it’s iterative. That means you may be revisiting certain stages to tweak and improve your designs as you work through the process.</p>
<p><img src="guides/UI_UX_Design_Guide/images/doublediamond.jpeg" alt="alt_text" title="double diamond design process" /></p>
</br>
<p>We recommend taking a look at the following resources to get started:</p>

<h2 id="user-research"><a class="header" href="#user-research">User Research <a name="userresearch"></a></a></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> user research is conducted to understand user needs and preferences— it’ll ensure that your designs are intuitive and meet user expectations.</p>
<p>User research happens throughout the design process and there’s different methods you can use at each stage. Some user research methods provide qualitative data (like user interviews) and others may provide more quantitative data (like close-ended surveys). Choosing which research method to use depends on various things like time availability, your research goals, type of product you’re building, etc.</p>
<p><img src="guides/UI_UX_Design_Guide/images/researchmethods.png" alt="alt_text" title="research methods" /></p>
<p><strong>We recommend starting with simple methods such as surveys and user interviews.</strong></p>
<p>Best practices to keep in mind for your research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it short (5-10 questions)</li>
<li>Keep it simple (use clear and concise language)</li>
<li>Avoid leading questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Best practices to keep in mind for user interviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use active listing techniques (build rapport with the participant, ask relevant follow-up questions)</li>
<li>Record &amp; transcribe your interviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of what a good survey question may look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problems do you face while trying to do (<em>given task</em>)? (select all that apply)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s some examples of what good user interview questions may look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you currently go about doing (<em>given task</em>)?</li>
<li>What do you like about how you currently perform (<em>given task</em>)?</li>
<li>What is the biggest pain point when performing (<em>given task</em>)?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="usability-testing"><a class="header" href="#usability-testing">Usability Testing <a name="usabilitytesting"></a></a></h2>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> usability testing will identify and address any usability issues— it’ll ensure your designs are intuitive and easy to use for its intended audience.</p>
<p>Once you have a working prototype, you’ll want to test that with users to get feedback on your designs.</p>
<p>With your usability testing, focus on exploratory tasks where you give users a realistic scenario and tasks to perform. For example, you could ask the user “add an item to your cart”, or “find an event to attend”. You want to see if (and where) users may get stuck doing a task— this will let you know which part of your design needs more work.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> testing with at least 5 users will give you sufficient feedback on your designs (these users can be fellow students, etc.)</p>

<p>Knowing how to use various things in Figma like: components, auto layout, and grids will help you design more efficiently.</p>
</br>
<h3 id="using-components"><a class="header" href="#using-components">Using Components</a></h3>
<p>“Components are elements you can reuse across your designs. They help to create and manage consistent designs across projects.” - Figma</p>
<p><img src="guides/UI_UX_Design_Guide/images/component.png" alt="alt_text" title="Figma component" /></p>
<p>Here’s a great resource to get your stated:</p>

</ul>
</br>
<h3 id="using-auto-layout"><a class="header" href="#using-auto-layout">Using Auto Layout</a></h3>
<p>Auto layout is important for creating responsive interfaces. “It lets you create designs that grow to fill or shrink to fit, and reflow as their contents change” - Figma</p>
<p>Resources for learning auto layout:</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="where-to-look-for-inspiration"><a class="header" href="#where-to-look-for-inspiration">Where to Look for Inspiration</a></h3>
<p>You might want to look at existing user interfaces to get inspiration for your own project. We recommend the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a></li>
<li>Scope existing platforms that are similar to your app that have good UI/UX &amp; take inspo from their designs</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h3 id="design-documentation"><a class="header" href="#design-documentation">Design Documentation</a></h3>
<p>It’s essential to document your designs. It’ll help you communicate the specifics of your designs with your team members and others.</p>
<p>Below is a good example of a card that documents the design of a screen. Your major screens and user flows should be documented.</p>
<p><img src="guides/UI_UX_Design_Guide/images/designdocumentation.png" alt="alt_text" title="design documentation" /></p>
</br>
<h3 id="accessibility-and-inclusion-in-design"><a class="header" href="#accessibility-and-inclusion-in-design">Accessibility and Inclusion in Design</a></h3>
<p>Here’s something important to keep in mind as you design. You want to ensure that everyone can use your designs— regardless of their abilities.</p>
<p>That means using colors, typography, etc. that are accessible to all users.</p>
<p>Here’s a great article to get started: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/accessibility-guidelines-for-a-ux-designer-c3ba775539be">Accessibility Guidelines for UX Designers</a></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#cloud-computing">Cloud Computing</a></h1>
<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of various computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, and software, over the internet. It provides faster innovation, flexibility, and cost savings, as you only pay for the services you use, allowing you to lower your costs and scale based on your business needs.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-cloud-computing">Benefits of Cloud Computing</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: Eliminate the upfront expense of hardware, software, and data centers by leveraging cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Quickly deploy services with just a few clicks, reducing time to market.</li>
<li><strong>Global Scale</strong>: Scale services globally, delivering resources from the nearest location to ensure low latency and optimal performance.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong>: Focus on core business objectives rather than managing physical servers and infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Simplify data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity through built-in redundancy.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Use advanced security features such as encryption and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Improve performance by distributing workloads across multiple servers and geographic regions for speed and redundancy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-cloud-computing"><a class="header" href="#types-of-cloud-computing">Types of Cloud Computing</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Cloud</strong>: Services are owned and operated by third-party cloud providers and delivered over the internet. You pay for only for what you use(AKA Operating expense-OpEx).</li>
<li><strong>Private Cloud</strong>: Infrastructure is owned and used exclusively by a single organization. you pay for all the Infrastructure upfront (AKA Capital expense-CapEx).</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>: Combines public and private cloud environments.</li>
<li><strong>Multi Cloud</strong>: Use multiple public cloud providers.</li>
</ul>
</br>
<h2 id="cloud-platform-models"><a class="header" href="#cloud-platform-models">Cloud Platform Models</a></h2>
<p>Cloud services come in more than one flavor. Choosing the right one will depend on your specific needs and how much fine control you'll need over the underlying gears and levers.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong><br />
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products generally simulate the look and feel you'd get from managing physical resources. laaS products give you direct access to a provider's compute, storage, and networking assets. Because it's you that's in there playing around at the hardware level, rather than the laaS provider, you are responsible for the consequences of any bad configurations. The trade-off is that you get to closely configure every layer of your operating stack.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2</strong>: Rent virtual servers to run applications with control over the OS and network settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform as a Service</strong><br />
Unlike laaS, Platform as a Service (PaaS) products simplify the process of building an application by hiding the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it. You're given an interface through which you define the behavior and environment you want for your application.
This will often include the code that will run your application.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>:
<ul>

<h2 id="overview-3"><a class="header" href="#overview-3">Overview</a></h2>
<p>AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to events without managing servers. Simply upload your function code, and Lambda handles the patching, and infrastructure management.</p>
<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Lambda functions are triggered by events such as API calls, file uploads to <code>S3</code>, or messages from services like SNS. Functions are stateless by default, meaning they don’t retain information between executions. AWS also supports stateful workflows using services like <code>DynamoDB</code> or <code>Step Functions</code>.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-serverless"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-serverless">Benefits of Serverless:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Server Management</strong>: Focus on writing code without dealing with infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Scaling</strong>: Functions automatically scale to handle any level of traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Efficient</strong>: You only pay for the compute time when your code runs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-writing-an-aws-lambda-function-in-python"><a class="header" href="#example-writing-an-aws-lambda-function-in-python">Example: Writing an AWS Lambda Function in Python</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html">AWS Lambda with Python documentation</a> includes the following example code snippet for writing a Lambda function in Python:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import boto3
import botocore

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    print(f'boto3 version: {boto3.__version__}')
    print(f'botocore version: {botocore.__version__}')
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>boto3</code> library is used, which is the AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python. This library allows your Python applications to interact with various AWS services, such as Lambda, S3, and EC2. The code also imports <code>botocore</code>, which is a low-level library that <code>boto3</code> relies on for making API requests to AWS services.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-lambda-function"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-lambda-function">Creating a Lambda Function</a></h2>
<p>To create a Lambda function, you need a deployment package. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code and any external libraries used in the code. However, you do not need to include <code>boto3</code> in the dependencies, since it is already included in the AWS Lambda Python runtime environment.</p>
<h2 id="installing-boto3"><a class="header" href="#installing-boto3">Installing boto3</a></h2>
<p>If you're testing or developing your Lambda function locally, you will need to install the <code>boto3</code> library using pip. Run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install boto3
</code></pre>

<p>Conflict resolution is the process of resolving differences
and disputes between individuals, groups,
or parties through peaceful means.
It involves identifying and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict,
promoting communication and understanding, cooperation,
and finding a mutually acceptable solution,
leading to increased productivity
and satisfaction in personal and professional settings.
When done correctly,
it helps to manage and resolve differences and disputes effectively,
preventing them from escalating into larger and more destructive problems.</p>
<p>The following document enumerates the trade-offs
of all conflict management styles,
and I highly encourage you to read it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.valamis.com/hub/conflict-management-styles">https://www.valamis.com/hub/conflict-management-styles</a>.</p>

<p>I would just add a last tip here:</p>
<p>Understand what motivates every person on your team.</p>
<p>For instance,
remember that a team of volunteers is very different from a team of employees.
On a volunteering team, the motivation factors usually are
self-development and being part of a cause.
The key in this setup
is aligning the team's objectives

<h1 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h1>
<p>Application secrets are critical for security.
For example, if an attacker discovers the database credentials,
then immediately this attacker would gain access to all of the applications data.
Application secrets is the entrypoint for everything, they are the Keys of Heaven,
and therefore, it's very important to make sure
that only the right people can get access to those secrets.</p>
<p>In this line of making application secrets be only accessible to the right people
we also need to make sure that developers can only access development secrets.
It's very common to have at least 2 environments: Development and Production,
and to have some kind of segmentation where only super admins can access Production secrets.</p>
<p>It also doesn't matter if your source code is private,
you still want to protect your secrets because your source code may be leaked,
as it has happened in the past to companies like Twitch.</p>
<p>There is also an argument about maintainability.
Secrets are also configuration, namely, their values may change over time,
even if the source code doesn't. For this reason it's recommended to
<a href="https://12factor.net/config">strictly separate them from the source code</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enables you to encrypt/decrypt the parts of a git of repository.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Versioned as code.</li>
<li>It's simple to use.</li>
<li>Great for a simple project, with no compliance needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot have multiple keys. All people share the same encryption key,
which means you cannot isolate environments,
and therefore is not that useful in highly regulated industries.</li>
<li>Unencrypted secrets touch the disk,
which is not great if someone steals your laptop while unencrypted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/tree/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets">https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/tree/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are <code>dev</code> and <code>prod</code> secrets with <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>, but they are encrypted, so we cannot see them unless we have they key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the key <a href="https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/raw/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/unsafe/key">here</a></p>
<p>Note: This should be distributed through a secure channel (e.g. encrypted email).
For the sake of simplicity you can download it here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we want to decrypt the secrets, for this we have to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git clone https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs.git docs
$ cd docs

docs $ cat src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/username
  &lt;you should see gibberish&gt;

# Decrypt
docs $ git-crypt unlock /path/to/key

# You should see the secrets now
docs $ cat src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/username
docs $ cat src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/password

# Encrypt
docs $ git-crypt lock
docs $ cat src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/username
  &lt;you should see gibberish again&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is understanding how it works, so essentially you configure which paths of the repository are encrypted in a <code>.gitattributes</code> file like this one:
<a href="https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/blob/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/.gitattributes">https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/blob/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/.gitattributes</a>,
where essentially we tell git-crypt to encrypt the files under the secrets/ folder. You can check which files are encrypted with</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ git-crypt status
   not encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/README.md
       encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/password
       encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/dev/username
       encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/prod/password
       encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/secrets/prod/username
   not encrypted: src/workshops/secrets-management/git-crypt/unsafe/key
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sops"><a class="header" href="#sops">Sops</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/mozilla/sops</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enables you to encrypt/decrypt JSON, YAML, or whole files.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Versioned as code.</li>
<li>You can have multiple keys and access control over a whole file,
great for highly regulated industries.</li>
<li>Keys can be connected to an AWS/GCP/Azure identity,
which is great in corporate environments,
and Age/PGP, which is great for other environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neutral:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not that easy to use, but reasonable given the features.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires some training to get used to it.</li>

<li>
<p>Download the development key
<a href="https://github.com/techstartucalgary/Docs/raw/main/src/workshops/secrets-management/sops/unsafe/dev-key.txt">here</a>

<p>The bad:</p>

CC0 1.0 Universal

    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
    INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
    REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
     communicate, and translate a Work;
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
     likeness depicted in a Work;
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
     in a Work;
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
     protection of databases, and under any national implementation
     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
     directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
     implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
&quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
